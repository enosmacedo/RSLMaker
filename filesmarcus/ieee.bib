abstract={The age of virtual healthcare has created new opportunities to reconsider traditional methods for the preliminary medical examinations and clinical doctor-patient appointments. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced medical systems for strengthening online services in each medical field. Implementations of novel digital health technologies will dramatically reduce inessential hospital visits of patients for early diagnosis. Moreover, the telehealth based medical platforms will allow the medical services to be time- and cost-effective with convenient media for both patients and doctors. In this study, an internet of medical things (IoMT)-based smart healthcare monitoring platform architecture is proposed to remotely telecommunicate with optimized bandwidth efficiency and latency for a rapid decision-making process management for preliminary diagnosis in a virtual environment. The proposed edge-IoMT computing architecture framework will allow filtering and squeezing of raw medical data of the real-time video footage of the patients with functional algorithms.},

abstract={Healthcare data streams originate from various sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) devices deployed in medical equipment and healthcare facilities as well as worn by patients. These vast volumes of data need to be leveraged to improve patient care, optimize processes, and help health sector stakeholders and applications make faster and more informed decisions. Many healthcare applications use the power of the cloud for data processing. However, time-sensitive healthcare applications cannot tolerate sending data streams to the cloud for processing due to unacceptable high latency and network bandwidth requirements. Healthcare facilities and caregivers need the ability to efficiently stream data and process data streams in real-time at the edge. This paper describes a five-tier architecture that aims to deal with the streaming and processing of data generated by the various devices and equipment of healthcare facilities and systems to enable the creation of smart healthcare applications. The architecture is based on emerging and established technologies, including IoT, edge/fog computing, data integration techniques, cloud computing, and data analytics. The proposed architecture will facilitate the creation of healthcare applications for real-time event detection, notification of alerts, and building monitoring dashboards. Fog node components include an advanced and widely recognized distributed messaging system, Apache Kafka, and the popular stream processing engine, Apache Storm, capable of processing large amounts of data.},

abstract={Access to healthcare services is one of the fundamental pillars of society today. People either have access to healthcare or they are not privileged enough to visit a doctor. In underprivileged societies, access to healthcare is difficult due to various reasons such as fewer number of doctors and healthcare facilities, inefficient communication means, and so on. This may result in exaggeration of the disease or threat to life. On the other hand, those who are privileged, end up paying unnecessary visits to the physician in most of the cases on an average (>71% in USA), and incurring high costs. Often-times, health issues are minor, and it is not necessary to visit a doctor. In such a case, the patient only requires suggestions on quick health fix, or some precautionary measures. Such information can be provided through the combination of a smartphone-based app, fog/edge computing, and mobile communication. Hence, reaching out to the doctors in their available time (off-time, commuting via public transit, so on) when they can answer some quick questions is one of the solutions that fit into smart healthcare definition, and truly pervasive healthcare. In this paper, we propose an innovative healthcare service architecture, called opportunistic healthcare (oHealth), where health log and questions can be opportunistically offloaded to a nearby (such as at public transit) compute entity (such as fog server) capable of processing health logs (up to 234,729 logs daily as per our setup). The fog node communicates the questions to a doctor, who provides the necessary feedback. We provide proof-of-concept evaluation results (in WiFi vs 4G networks, on the basis of delay, cost, and commute time, comparing cloud with fog) to endorse the applicability of our oHealth.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is the interconnection of physical objects or devices that can transmit and receive data through the internet without human involvement. With the advancement in IoT devices particularly in healthcare sector, huge amount of data is collected from different sensors and all this data are transferred and stored in cloud. It becomes difficult to handle such huge amount of data in cloud specially the healthcare data where it requires real time data computation and storage. Security of the data is also major challenge in cloud. Fog computing is the answer to overcome the challenges. Fog nodes works at the edge side and enhances data security, accuracy, consistency and reduces the latency rate which is an important factor for application like medical data. Implementation work is also described in the paper where a digital human temperature sensor device is built using DS18B20 temperature sensor. The data collected from it is being encrypted in fog node using Advance Encryption Standard(AES) algorithm and it is send to cloud. Therefore, the security of the health care data is enhanced using Fog computing.},

abstract={Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) based healthcare applications are categorized as those delay-sensitive online services that could not tolerate delay because of its negative and dangerous consequences on people's lives. Hence, many researchers try to propose novel approaches in order to improve the Quality of Service in online healthcare systems. As the network architecture plays an important role in providing a suitable level of QoS for any kind of applications, we aim to evaluate the performance of two different paradigms with different architectures, namely Cloud and Fog computing on performance of a WBSN based healthcare application. Using Cloud architecture for processing and storage of provided data by WBSNs has been deeply discussed in the literature. As Cloud resources are only accessible through the Internet, any network failure or Internet disconnection causes a high response time which is not tolerable by healthcare applications. In this paper, we investigate the role of Fog computing on reducing the response time and Internet traffic for a WBSN based healthcare application in a real-world test-bed. The achieved results show that in comparison to Cloud, the Fog-based architecture reduces the response time and Internet traffic by 46% and 77% respectively.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of resource-constrained smart devices capable to sense and process data. It connects a huge number of smart sensing devices, i.e., things, and heterogeneous networks. The IoT is incorporated into different applications, such as smart health, smart home, smart grid, etc. The concept of smart healthcare has emerged in different countries, where pilot projects of healthcare facilities are analyzed. In IoT-enabled healthcare systems, the security of IoT devices and associated data is very important, whereas Edge computing is a promising architecture that solves their computational and processing problems. Edge computing is economical and has the potential to provide low latency data services by improving the communication and computation speed of IoT devices in a healthcare system. In Edge-based IoT-enabled healthcare systems, load balancing, network optimization, and efficient resource utilization are accurately performed using artificial intelligence (AI), i.e., intelligent software-defined network (SDN) controller. SDN-based Edge computing is helpful in the efficient utilization of limited resources of IoT devices. However, these low powered devices and associated data (private sensitive data of patients) are prone to various security threats. Therefore, in this paper, we design a secure framework for SDN-based Edge computing in IoT-enabled healthcare system. In the proposed framework, the IoT devices are authenticated by the Edge servers using a lightweight authentication scheme. After authentication, these devices collect data from the patients and send them to the Edge servers for storage, processing, and analyses. The Edge servers are connected with an SDN controller, which performs load balancing, network optimization, and efficient resource utilization in the healthcare system. The proposed framework is evaluated using computer-based simulations. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides better solutions for IoT-enabled healthcare systems.},

abstract={Cloud-based IoT architectures are expecting a fast data transfer rate within a limited bandwidth. But achieving a fast data transfer rate is becoming more difficult gradually, with the massive amount of data produced by the IoT devices. The concept of edge computing gives a solution to this problem and provides fast interaction between data centers and IoT devices. With the help of edge computing, the data transfer rate has been increased drastically within a limited bandwidth. As a result, edge computing is being used in different IoT based industry including the IoT based healthcare industry. On the other hand, the distributed nature of the edge computing paradigm introduces security and privacy concerns (e.g., data theft). The IoT based healthcare solutions are getting popular among the users. Therefore, users' highly sensitive data is at high risk of theft before eventually reaching the cloud. Nowadays, these issues are being solved by introducing blockchain in different architectures. Hence, this paper is utilizing blockchain technology for providing a user-centric secure edge computing architecture for healthcare IoT devices. We are proposing to integrate blockchain to store the users' data transfer records and ensuring data security by managing the number of blockchain transactions. We are providing user-centricity by allowing users to monitor their data transactions.},

abstract={The increase in the growth of healthcare IoT devices leads to a large volume and variety of healthcare data. The large healthcare data generates high data traffic that will cause network bottleneck and burdens the cloud with an extra amount of workload. The main requirement of healthcare IoT is to have a minimum network and service latency along with conserve network bandwidth. Both the volume of data as well as factors related to internet connectivity may lead to high network latency in analyzing and acting upon device data. Therefore, due to high network latency, high service latency and large data transmission from IoT devices, the cloud is unable to send the patient health data in real-time mode. Fog computing is a new approach to address this requirement of cloud and healthcare IoT devices. A tentative novel solution for the above-mentioned problem using fuzzy-based fog computing architecture that integrates healthcare IoT devices with the cloud and uses fog services with Fuzzy Data Packet Allocation (FDPA) algorithm.

abstract={Smart city advancements are driving massive transformations of healthcare, the largest global industry. The drivers include increasing demands for ubiquitous, preventive, and personalized healthcare, to be provided to the public at reduced risks and costs. Mobile cloud computing could potentially meet the future healthcare demands by enabling anytime, anywhere capture and analyses of patients' data. However, network latency, bandwidth, and reliability are among the many challenges hindering the realization of next-generation healthcare. This paper proposes a ubiquitous healthcare framework, UbeHealth, that leverages edge computing, deep learning, big data, high-performance computing (HPC), and the Internet of Things (IoT) to address the aforementioned challenges. The framework enables an enhanced network quality of service using its three main components and four layers. Deep learning, big data, and HPC are used to predict network traffic, which in turn are used by the Cloudlet and network layers to optimize data rates, data caching, and routing decisions. Application protocols of the traffic flows are classified, enabling the network layer to meet applications' communication requirements better and to detect malicious traffic and anomalous data. Clustering is used to identify the different kinds of data originating from the same application protocols. A proof of concept UbeHealth system has been developed based on the framework. A detailed literature review is used to capture the design requirements for the proposed system. The system is described in detail including the algorithmic implementation of the three components and four layers. Three widely used data sets are used to evaluate the UbeHealth system.},

We present the first review on fog computing within healthcare informatics, and explore, classify, and discuss different application use cases presented in the literature. For that, we categorize applications into use case classes and list an inventory of application-specific tasks that can be handled by fog computing. We discuss on which level of the network such fog computing tasks can be executed, and provide tradeoffs with respect to requirements relevant to healthcare. Our review indicates that: 1) there is a significant number of computing tasks in healthcare that require or can benefit from fog computing principles; 2) processing on higher network tiers is required due to constraints in wireless devices and the need to aggregate data; and 3) privacy concerns and dependability prevent computation tasks to be completely moved to the cloud. These findings substantiate the need for a coherent approach toward fog computing in healthcare, for which we present a list of recommended research and development actions.},

abstract={Over the last decade, the number of Internet of Things (IoT) smart devices has grown exponentially. In order to support the computational demand of real-time latency-sensitive applications in healthcare, a new paradigm named Fog Computing has emerged. Fog Computing is located closer to the IoT devices/sensors and is considered to be an extension of the Cloud Computing. In this paper, a hospital ward room is used as a case study, where the scenario is simulated using the iFogSim simulator, in order to evaluate and analyse its behaviour in terms of latency, network usage, cost of transmission, and power consumption. The results point out the possibility to enhance Quality of Service for patients and care givers by adding the Fog Computing layer to the current Cloud infrastructure.},

abstract={With the wide application of mobile healthcare systems, the total amount of healthcare data is ever increasing rapidly as users interact with healthcare service providers frequently. This leads to a challenging task to manage healthcare data. Existing work mainly pay attention to centralized and blockchain-based mechanisms. But they cannot adapt to the increasing amount of global healthcare data and suffer from complex application challenges, respectively. Decentralized and collaborative data management assisted by edge computing exhibits major advantages in improving overall system performance. We present a secure and efficient data management system named as EdgeCare for mobile healthcare systems. Local authorities are established to schedule edge servers for processing healthcare data and facilitating data trading. A hierarchical architecture with collaboration is designed for feasible implementation of EdgeCare. After that, we investigate secure data uploading and sharing in the system. We use an electronic medical record to show how healthcare data is processed with security considerations. We also conduct the Stackelberg game-based optimization algorithm to approach the optimal incentive mechanism for a data collector and users in the fair decentralized data trading. The numerical results with security analysis are provided to demonstrate that EdgeCare offers effective solutions to protect healthcare data, and support efficient data trading.},

abstract={A large spectrum of healthcare applications, ranging from continuous blood sugar level monitoring to sleep apnea detection are nowadays facilitated by modern mobile gadgets. Wearable and ambient sensors generate enormous amounts of physiological data that demand high computation power for real-time processing and large storage area for recording the personal data. In order to conserve the energy on the battery-limited mainstream mobile devices of the end-users, the execution of the healthcare applications may be offloaded to a remote server. While cloud computing provides unlimited pool of resources for latency-tolerant services such as training a machine learning model, the personalization of healthcare services and the delay sensitivity of continuous health assessment necessitate a computation infrastructure in the vicinity of the end-users. As a remedy to address various demands of a wide range of pervasive healthcare applications, we propose a multi-tier computing and communication architecture composed of end-user devices, edge servers, and legacy cloud data-centers. The dynamic management of this architecture, policies to be applied within the network and the orchestration of the healthcare services are carried out by the concept of programmable networks, in the form of software-defined networking (SDN). As a concrete demonstration of our ideas, a fall risk assessment service is implemented and an experimental study is conducted to evaluate its accuracy and the performance of the multi-tier architecture. The results indicate that the proposed architecture is feasible to enable real-time healthcare services and has significant performance advantages over traditional cloud-based approaches.},

abstract={The vast development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud-enabled data processing solutions provide the opportunity to build novel and fascinating smart, connected healthcare systems. Smart healthcare systems analyze the IoT-generated patient data to both enhance the quality of patient care and reduce healthcare costs. A major challenge for these systems is how the Cloud of Things can handle the data generated from billions of connected IoT devices. Edge computing infrastructure offers a promising solution by operating as a middle layer between the IoT devices and cloud computing. The Edge of Things (EoT) can offer small-scale real-time computing and storage capabilities that ensures low latency and optimal utilization of the IoT resources. However, the EoT has privacy-preservation issues, which is a significant concern for the healthcare systems that contain sensitive patient data. This paper introduces a novel EoT computing framework for secure and smart healthcare surveillance services. Fully homomorphic encryption preserves data privacy and is stored and processed within an EoT framework. A distributed approach for clustering-based techniques is developed for the proposed EoT framework with the scalability to aggregate and analyze the large-scale and heterogeneous data in the distributed EoT devices independently before it is sent to the cloud. We demonstrate the proposed framework by evaluating a case study for the patient biosignal data. Our framework rapidly accelerates the analysis response time and performance of the encrypted data processing while preserving a high level of analysis accuracy and data privacy.},

abstract={There is a severe need for continuous monitoring of health condition and behaviour of patients, dependents, and senior citizens. Often such people require continuous presence of medical staff for observing health condition and behaviour. However, unavailability of such medical observers at certain places and at certain locations may result into failure from obtaining sudden spikes in such patient's health parameters and behaviour. In order to prevent such failures, advantage of recent advancements in ICT and IoT can be taken in development of Ambient Assisted Healthcare (AAHC) systems. AAHC systems provide self-care support to people suffering with health problems or disabilities. Cloud computing enabled AAHC systems are available. However, study suggests that evolution of intelligent devices and fog computing has coined many crucial challenges against the cloud computing based solutions. Fog computing helps overcome such deficiencies. A detailed review of fog computing based existing AAHC systems is presented in this paper.},

abstract={Recently, researchers around the world in medical institutions and pharmaceutical companies are demanding a wider access to healthcare data for secondary use in order to provide enhanced and personalized medical services. For this purpose, healthcare information exchange between health authorities can be leveraged as a fundamental concept to meet these demands and enable the discovery of new insights and cures. However, health data are highly sensitive and private information that requires strong authentication and authorization procedures to manage the access to them. In this regard, the cloud paradigm has been used in these e-healthcare solutions, but they remain inefficient due to their inability to adapt to the expanding volume of data generated from body sensors and their vulnerability against cyberattacks. Hence, collaborative and distributed data governance supported by edge computing and blockchain promises enormous potentials in improving the performance and security of the whole system. In this paper, we present a secure and efficient data management framework, named ”EdgeMediChain”, for sharing health data. The proposed architecture leverages both edge computing and blockchain to facilitate and provide the necessary requirements for a healthcare ecosystem in terms of scalability, security, as well as privacy. The Ethereum-based testbed evaluations show the effectiveness of EdgeMediChain in terms of execution time with a reduction of nearly 84.75% for 2000 concurrent transactions, higher throughput compared to a traditional blockchain, and scalable ledger storage with a linear growth rate.},

abstract={In recent years, healthcare IoT have been helpful in mitigating pressures of hospital and medical resources caused by aging population to a large extent. As a safety-critical system, the rapid response from the health care system is extremely important. To fulfill the low latency requirement, fog computing is a competitive solution by deploying healthcare IoT devices on the edge of clouds. However, these fog devices generate huge amount of sensor data. Designing a specific framework for fog devices to ensure reliable data transmission and rapid data processing becomes a topic of utmost significance. In this paper, a Reduced Variable Neighborhood Search (RVNS)-based sEnsor Data Processing Framework (REDPF) is proposed to enhance reliability of data transmission and processing speed. Functionalities of REDPF include fault-tolerant data transmission, self-adaptive filtering and data-load-reduction processing. Specifically, a reliable transmission mechanism, managed by a self-adaptive filter, will recollect lost or inaccurate data automatically. Then, a new scheme is designed to evaluate the health status of the elderly people. Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposed scheme improves network reliability, and provides a faster processing speed.},

abstract={The healthcare sector is now blending with Information and Communications Technology (ICT) using Internet of Things (IoT) to potentially minimise medical errors and reduce healthcare cost. Patients are now embedded with smart devices like body sensors and wearable devices which can monitor their health without the need for a doctor in physical contact. Such smart devices have the downside of low battery power and are unable to transmit their data to the medical personnel when the patient is on the move away from the smart home/smart clinic fixed gateway. A mobile gateway is required which moves with the patient to process the smart device data without depleting the smartphone battery. This paper proposes an Intelligent and Energy Efficient SG based smartphone Gateway for healthcare smart devices (IEE5GG). In IEE5GG, the 5G architecture is adopted and the patient's smartphone is used as a gateway where multiple smart devices are connected e.g. via Bluetooth. To save energy, requests to the smartphone can either be executed on the smartphone gateway or offloaded and executed in the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) cloud at close proximity to the smartphone in the 5G Base Station (BS) central Unit (gNB-CU) while considering the transmission power, Quality of Service (QoS), smartphone battery level and Central Processing Unit (CPU) load. Results show that the proposed IEE5GG framework saves up to 38% of energy in the healthcare mobile gateway smartphone and reduces healthcare application service time by up to 41%.},

abstract={Rapid developments in the fields of information and communication technology and microelectronics allowed seamless interconnection among various devices letting them to communicate with each other. This technological integration opened up new possibilities in many disciplines including healthcare and well-being. With the aim of reducing healthcare costs and providing improved and reliable services, several healthcare frameworks based on Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) have been developed. However, due to the critical and heterogeneous nature of healthcare data, maintaining high quality of service (QoS)-in terms of faster responsiveness and data-specific complex analytics-has always been the main challenge in designing such systems. Addressing these issues, this paper proposes a five-layered heterogeneous mist, fog, and cloud-based IoHT framework capable of efficiently handling and routing (near-)real-time as well as offline/batch mode data. Also, by employing software defined networking and link adaptation-based load balancing, the framework ensures optimal resource allocation and efficient resource utilization. The results, obtained by simulating the framework, indicate that the designed network via its various components can achieve high QoS, with reduced end-to-end latency and packet drop rate, which is essential for developing next generatione-healthcare systems.},

abstract={With the pervasive usage of IoT devices to collect healthcare data from human body, the real-time need on data acquirement and analysis for effective diagnosis and feedbacks becomes an challenging issue in practice. We propose a hybrid architecture, called EdgeCNN, that balances the capability of edge and cloud computing to address this issue for agile learning of healthcare data from IoT devices. Specifically, deep learning is customized as the inference method running on edge devices, making real-time analysis and diagnosis closer to the IoT data source. This can significantly reduce learning latency and network I/O, ease the pressure on the cloud platform for large user groups and massive data, and drastically decrease the cost to build and maintain cloud platforms. To verify the feasibility of EdgeCNN, we design a set of streamlined diagnosis model and learning algorithm for edge computing based on convolutional neural network (CNN), facilitating EdgeCNN to identify and infer electrocardiograms in real-time, as a specific healthcare application using smart devices on the edge. Our experimental results show that under the premise of ensuring the accuracy, EdgeCNN has significant advantages in diagnosis delay, network I/O, application usability and resource cost, in comparison with the architecture solely based on the cloud computing. Another important benefit from EdgeCNN is that it can effectively protect the privacy of user data from IoT devices.},

abstract={The use of Information and Communications Technology (ICTs) in healthcare has the potential of minimizing medical errors, reducing healthcare cost and improving collaboration between healthcare systems which can dramatically improve the healthcare service quality. However interoperability within different healthcare systems (clinics/hospitals/pharmacies) remains an issue of further research due to a lack of collaboration and exchange of healthcare information. To solve this problem, cross healthcare system collaboration is required. This paper proposes a conceptual semantic based healthcare collaboration framework based on Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure that is able to offer a secure cross system information and knowledge exchange between different healthcare systems seamlessly that is readable by both machines and humans. In the proposed framework, an intelligent semantic gateway is introduced where a web application with restful Application Programming Interface (API) is used to expose the healthcare information of each system for collaboration. A case study that exposed the patient's data between two different healthcare systems was practically demonstrated where a pharmacist can access the patient's electronic prescription from the clinic.},

abstract={Fog computing (alternatively known as Edge computing) is a new paradigm that can be used near mobile devices to perform computational tasks effectively and efficiently. There can be many possible computational models for mobile devices using fog computing to get the tasks done. A smart city is a framework where mobile devices such as smartphones, smart wearable devices, mobile computing devices and many more communicate with each other, with neighboring devices and with other infrastructure such as wireless access points deployed in the city to use services and facilities provided within the smart city. A key requirement of any smart city is the availability of a seamless, reliable, secure broadband wireless network to support the services provided by the municipalities as well as other commercial service providers. An example of such potential wireless networks is new 5G technology that is being tested currently and will be available commercially in the near future. The objective of a smart city is to provide excellent quality of life to its residents using such new technologies through sustainable means. In this paper, we address the research question that what will be the role of fog computing in a smart city where 5G enabled wireless technology is used. We present a conceptual model called Smart-City-Fog model and describe its functionalities in the context of smart cities.},

abstract={Edge computing paradigm has attracted many interests in the last few years as a valid alternative to the standard cloud-based approaches to reduce the interaction timing and the huge amount of data coming from Internet of Things (IoT) devices toward the Internet. In the next future, Edge-based approaches will be essential to support time-dependent applications in the Industry 4.0 context; thus, the paper proposes BodyEdge, a novel architecture well suited for human-centric applications, in the context of the emerging healthcare industry. It consists of a tiny mobile client module and a performing edge gateway supporting multiradio and multitechnology communication to collect and locally process data coming from different scenarios; moreover, it also exploits the facilities made available from both private and public cloud platforms to guarantee a high flexibility, robustness, and adaptive service level. The advantages of the designed software platform have been evaluated in terms of reduced transmitted data and processing time through a real implementation on different hardware platforms.

abstract={Fog computing is considered as the most promising enhancement of the traditional cloud computing paradigm in order to handle potential issues introduced by the emerging Interned of Things (IoT) framework at the network edge. The heterogeneous nature, the extensive distribution and the hefty number of deployed IoT nodes will disrupt existing functional models, creating confusion. However, IoT will facilitate the rise of new applications, with automated healthcare monitoring platforms being amongst them. This paper presents the pillars of design for such applications, along with the evaluation of a working prototype that collects ECG traces from a tailor-made device and utilizes the patient's smartphone as a Fog gateway for securely sharing them to other authorized entities.

abstract={Cloud computing technologies such as virtualization and orchestration have revolutionized a great number of different domains, from the industry to healthcare. However, there are still certain applications that can not take advantage of this paradigm due to stricter requirements such as end-to-end response times. A new paradigm called Fog computing is arising to answer the needs of these applications. Fog nodes have lower hardware resources that their Cloud counterparts and are distributed over a wider geographical area. Porting technologies designed for the Cloud, specifically orchestration, to this new paradigm requires to handle these peculiarities. A novel orchestration architecture is proposed evolving on current ones, directly focusing Fog characteristics. Multiple schedulers are dynamically deployed in order to achieve a better scheduling throughput and spread the resources required by the scheduler among multiple lower-resource nodes. It uses an application-centric approach at the scheduler level in order to enable new scheduling parameters. The scheduling throughput of this architecture is compared to the most common Cloud orchestration architecture.},

abstract={With the advent of new technologies and the fast pace of human life, patients today require a sophisticated and advanced smart healthcare framework that is tailored to suit their individual health requirements. Along with 5G and state-of-the-art smart Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, edge computing provides intelligent, real-time healthcare solutions that satisfy energy consumption and latency criteria. Earlier surveys on smart healthcare systems were centered on cloud and fog computing architectures, security, and authentication, and the types of sensors and devices used in edge computing frameworks. They did not focus on the healthcare IoT applications deployed within edge computing architectures. The first purpose of this study is to analyze the existing and evolving edge computing architectures and techniques for smart healthcare and recognize the demands and challenges of different application scenarios. We examine edge intelligence that targets health data classification with the tracking and identification of vital signs using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. This study also presents a comprehensive analysis of the use of cutting-edge artificial intelligence-based classification and prediction techniques employed for edge intelligence. Even with its many advantages, edge intelligence poses challenges related to computational complexity and security. To offer a higher quality of life to patients, potential research recommendations for improving edge computing services for healthcare are identified in this study. This study also offers a brief overview of the general usage of IoT solutions in edge platforms for medical treatment and healthcare.},

abstract={In the last years, the emergence of pervasive connected devices and the development of the cloud computing paradigms brought a revolution in health-care and industrial applications. Cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) exploit large scale service providers to vastly reduce costs and gather Big Data. However, cloud-based services still face various issues related to: high bandwidth requirements, unpredictable delays, and security and safety concerns. These issues are critical to health-care and Active and Assisted Living (AAL) where a correct and timely reaction can result in saving a life or drastically reducing a disability (e.g. after a stroke). In this scenario, we present a flexible multi-level architecture using the fog approach, a computing paradigm in which heterogeneous devices at the edge of the network collect data, compute a task with minimal latency, and produce physical actions meaningful for the user, leveraging upon context and location awareness. In this paper, we envision also an edge node built upon Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. The hardware of a FPGA node can be reconfigured to produce maximum performance in tasks, to guarantee a minimal delay, or the capacity to scale on the number of devices connected, with a minimal power consumption. We present two case studies for assistive smart ambients and health applications designed on our Fog architecture.},

We propose the ChainSDI framework that leverages the blockchain technique along with abundant edge computing resources to manage secure data sharing and computing on sensitive patient data. We implement programmable ChainSDI application programming interfaces to facilitate the specification of home-based healthcare services running on a software-defined infrastructure (SDI). This article is a collaboration between computer scientists, medical researchers, healthcare IT professionals as well as healthcare providers with the goal of increasing the availability of SDI infrastructures while meeting the performance and regulatory requirements of healthcare applications.

abstract={Nowadays, a large amount of services are deployed on the edge of the network from the cloud since processing data at the edge can reduce response time and lower bandwidth cost for applications such as healthcare in smart homes. Resource management is very important in the edge computing since it is able to increase the system efficiency and improve the quality of service. A common approach for resource management in edge computing is to assign tasks to the remote cloud or edge devices just according to several factors such as energy, bandwidth consumption, and latency. However, the approach is insufficiently efficient and falls short in meeting the requirements of handling health emergency when being applied in smart homes for healthcare. Possible health emergency needs immediate attention and different health tasks have different priorities to be processed. In this paper, we propose a task scheduling approach called HealthEdge that sets different processing priorities for different tasks based on the collected data on human health status and determines whether a task should run in a local device or a remote cloud in order to reduce its total processing time as much as possible. Based on a real trace from five patients, we conduct a trace-driven experiment to evaluate the performance of HealthEdge in comparison with other methods. The results show that HealthEdge can optimally assign tasks between the network edge and cloud, which can reduce the task processing time, reduce bandwidth consumption and increase local edge workstation utilization.},

abstract={Recent advances in mobile technologies and cloud computing services have inspired the development of cloud-based real-time health monitoring systems. However, the transfer of health-related data to the cloud contributes to the burden on the networking infrastructures, leading to high latency and increased power consumption. Fog computing is introduced to relieve this burden by bringing services to the users' proximity. This study proposes a new fog computing architecture for health monitoring applications based on a Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) access network. An Energy-Efficient Fog Computing (EEFC) model is developed using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to optimize the number and location of fog devices at the network edge to process and analyze the health data for energy-efficient fog computing. The performance of the EEFC model at low data rates and high data rates health applications is studied. The outcome of the study reveals that a total energy saving of 36% and 52% are attained via processing and analysis the health data at the fog in comparison to conventional processing and analysis at the central cloud for low data rate application and high data rate application, respectively. We also developed a real-time heuristic; Energy Optimized Fog Computing (EOFC) heuristic, with energy consumption performance approaching the EEFC model. Furthermore, we examined the energy efficiency improvements under different scenarios of devices idle power consumption and traffic volume.},

abstract={Tactile edge technology that focuses on 5G or beyond 5G reveals an exciting approach to control infectious diseases such as COVID-19 internationally. The control of epidemics such as COVID-19 can be managed effectively by exploiting edge computation through the 5G wireless connectivity network. The implementation of a hierarchical edge computing system provides many advantages, such as low latency, scalability, and the protection of application and training model data, enabling COVID-19 to be evaluated by a dependable local edge server. In addition, many deep learning (DL) algorithms suffer from two crucial disadvantages: first, training requires a large COVID-19 dataset consisting of various aspects, which will pose challenges for local councils; second, to acknowledge the outcome, the findings of deep learning require ethical acceptance and clarification by the health care sector, as well as other contributors. In this article, we propose a B5G framework that utilizes the 5G network's low-latency, high-bandwidth functionality to detect COVID-19 using chest X-ray or CT scan images, and to develop a mass surveillance system to monitor social distancing, mask wearing, and body temperature. Three DL models, ResNet50, Deep tree, and Inception v3, are investigated in the proposed framework. Furthermore, blockchain technology is also used to ensure the security of healthcare data.},

abstract={In today's era health informatics is a major contributor to the advancements in ubiquitous computing. Of late, the concept of mobile health (mHealth) systems has attracted considerable attention from both medical computer science communities. mHealth devices generate a significant amount of patient data on a timely basis. This data is often stored on cloud-based EHR and PHR systems to aid in timely and better quality healthcare service. However, as has been seen lately, stored personal records act as honeypots for malicious entities and the internet underground. It is thus imperative to prevent unauthorized leakage of mHealth data from cloud-based E/PHR systems. As observed from some of our preliminary research, NIST's policy machine (PM) framework suits the access control modeling requirements posed by mHealth systems. Moreover, the graph-based model adopted by this framework allows efficient policy management through advanced graph search techniques. In this paper, we leverage the policy machine model to propose a cloud-based service that achieves secure storage and fine-grained dissemination of mHealth data. The primary goal of this work is to demonstrate the applicability of the PM framework to the mHealth domain and illustrate the workflow of an algorithm to resolve access decisions in theoretically faster time than achieved by existing implementations.},

Innovation and development in IoT have established new ways to analyze patient data in healthcare systems. Currently, IoT and cloud-based solutions are available to process and analyze patient data, but cloud computing causes large end-to-end delay and network usage problems while processing huge amounts of data. Efficiency and security are still a challenge in IoT-based healthcare systems. Fog computing is introduced to overcome the issues of cloud computing by providing computing and storage services at the edge of the network. In this article, first we present a fog based efficient architecture for IoT-based healthcare systems. Then we present the user authentication method through identity management to prevent security breaches. The fog based architecture for healthcare includes the idea of a virtual machine (VM) partitioning in fog node to smoothly run the body sensor network and medical IoT devices data.

abstract={Health care services have become a high demand due to the rise in medical technology. As a result, related resources are being depleted. Hospitals no longer have any space to accommodate for incoming patients. Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) is a solution to this issue by creating a convenient and easy to access healthcare service. However, RPM systems are constrained by concerns on patient privacy, response time, and patient-service interaction. Patients emphasize their privacy, which requires health care services to maintain the confidentiality of their patient's information. Wearable health monitors continuously transmit data. This feature results in high volumes of data transmissions towards the servers. In the current state of wearable devices, there is a lack of giving the patient an integrated means of interacting with the healthcare centre and vice versa. In this paper, we propose an architecture that uses fog computing and Internet of Things (IoT) devices to an already existing RPM system and addresses these challenges. The introduced system enables the health care providers to verify any of their data through a local server before it is reported to the main server. Also, this design incorporates a data filter that controls the outgoing data to maintain patient privacy. Finally, the inclusion of a local server offloads the extra data processing that is required from the server for a better flow of data. Tests in latency were executed to investigate the feasibility of a scalable fog architecture against a standard cloud-device setup. The results show that the proposed fog setup yielded significantly lower latencies under an increasing number of RPM rooms compared to the cloud setup. Results further support the fog and IoT-based architecture as a potential option for a scalable RPM.},

abstract={Cloud-based healthcare service with the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is a model for healthcare delivery for urban areas and vulnerable population that utilizes the digital communications and the IoHT to provide flexible opportunities to transform all the health data into workable, personalized health insights, and help attain wellness outside the traditional hospital setting. This model of healthcare Web services acts like a living organism, taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by running in cloud infrastructure to connect patients and providers anywhere and anytime to improve the quality of care, with the IoHT, acting as a central nervous system for this model that measures patients' vital statistics, constantly logging their health data, and report any abnormalities to the relevant healthcare provider. However, it is crucial to preserve the privacy of patients while utilizing this model so as to maintain their satisfaction and trust in the offered services. With the increasing number of cases for privacy breaches of healthcare data, different countries and corporations have issued privacy laws and regulations to define the best practices for the protection of personal health information. The health insurance portability and accountability act and the privacy principles established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are examples of such regulation frameworks. In this paper, we assert that utilizing the cloud-based healthcare services to generate accurate health insights are feasible, while preserving the privacy of the end-users' sensitive health information, which will be residing on a clear form only on his/her own personal gateway. To support this claim, the personal gateways at the end-users' side will act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between the IoHT devices and the cloud-based healthcare services. In such solution, these fog nodes will host a holistic privacy middleware that executes a two-stage concealment process within a distributed data collection protocol that utilizes the hierarchical nature of the IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. Additionally, the proposed solution complies with one of the common privacy regulation frameworks for fair information practice in a natural and functional way-which is OECD privacy principles. We depicted how the proposed approach can be integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the users' health data that is utilized by a cloud-based healthcare recommender service in order to generate accurate referrals. Our holistic approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both end-users and service providers.},

abstract={Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) offers innovative solutions to a healthier life, making radical changes in people's lives. Healthcare providers are enabled to continuously and remotely monitor their patients for many medial issues outside hospitals and healthcare providers' offices. MIoT systems and applications lead to increase availability, accessibility, quality and cost-effectiveness of healthcare services. On the other hand, MIoT devices generate a large amount of diverse real-time data, which is highly sensitive. Thus, securing medical data is an essential requirement when developing MIoT architectures. However, the MIoT architectures being developed in the literature have many security issues. To address the challenge of data security in MIoT, the integration of fog computing and MIoT is studied as an emerging and appropriate solution. By data security, it means that medial data is stored in fog nodes and transferred to the cloud in a secure manner to prevent any unauthorized access. In this paper, we propose a design for a secure fog-cloud based architecture for MIoT.},

abstract={Smart healthcare monitoring systems provide better healthcare service by improving the availability and transparency of health data. However, it also posses serious threats to data security and privacy. As medical internet of things (IoT) are connected to other devices through various networks that provide a suitable attack surface for the intruders. Further, the health data are sensitive, and any breach in security may lead to wrong treatment or compromising the privacy of the patients. In this regard, a secure IoT frame is desirable, which is capable of preserving the integrity and confidentiality of the medical data. In this paper, we have proposed a novel architecture which leverages the blockchain technology to enhance the security and privacy of IoT for healthcare applications. In the proposed architecture called smart healthcare system for patients in ICU (SHPI), critical data is processed in edge computing which is located inside the hospital to reduce the communication latency. In order to provide tramper-proof medical records and data confidentiality SHPI uses blockchain technology and cryptographic methods respectively. Also, a data accessing token system is introduced to separate the group of users based on their roles. This system utilizes smart contracts to record every event for providing transparency in medical activities. In order to describe the working principles a logical analysis is carried out, that shows the system is capable of providing the desired security and privacy.},

abstract={Chikungunya virus is an infection which is transmitted to humans by the bite of Aedes agypti and Aedes albopictis mosquitoes. It causes deterioration in health leading to multiorgan failure. Diagnostic tests for this virus are not easily available and affordable in developing countries. The medical technologies are not so efficient in diagnosing and preventing the outbreak of Chikungunya virus. Healthcare services based on a fog-cloud technology are emerging as a proactive and effective solution to provide remote detection and monitoring of users. A fog assisted healthcare system can be used to diagnose users infected by Chikungunya virus in an initial state of their infection so that proper treatment can be given to them on time to enable fast recovery. In this paper, a fog assisted cloud-based healthcare system is designed to diagnose and prevent the outbreak of this virus. Initially, a decision tree is used to classify the category of user's infection depending on his/her health symptoms and diagnostic alerts are immediately generated on the user's mobile phone from fog layer. Furthermore, the state of Chikungunya virus outbreak is represented using temporal network analysis (TNA) on cloud layer using proximity data. Various outbreak metrics from TNA graph are calculated which indicate the probability to receive or transmit Chikungunya infection to human beings. Results depict that J48 decision tree classifier has higher accuracy and lower response time in determining the level of Chikungunya virus infection as compared to other classification algorithms. Moreover, alert generation based on real-time healthcare data further enhances the utility of the proposed system.},

As health is a sensitive issue, it should be taken care of with utmost security and caution. This article proposes a new medical image forgery detection system for the healthcare framework to verify that images related to healthcare are not changed or altered. The system works on a noise map of an image, applies a multi-resolution regression filter on the noise map, and feeds the output to support-vector-machine-based and extreme-learning-based classifiers.

Technologies such as 5G, edge computing, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things realize smart healthcare that a client can have anytime, anywhere, and in real time. Edge computing offers useful computing resources at the edge of the network to maintain low-latency and real-time computing. In this article, we propose a smart healthcare framework using edge computing. In the framework, we develop a voice disorder assessment and treatment system using a deep learning approach. A client provides his or her voice sample captured by smart sensors, and the sample goes to the edge computing for initial processing. Then the edge computing sends data to a core cloud for further processing. The assessment and management are controlled by a service provider through a cloud manager. Once the automatic assessment is done, the decision is sent to specialists, who prescribe appropriate treatment to the clients.

abstract={In the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era, there is an increasing trend to enable intelligent behavior in edge computing sensors. Thus, a new generation of smart wearable devices for health monitoring is being developed, able to perform complex Digital Signal Processing (DSP) routines that extract features of clinical relevance from the acquired data. These new edge computing sensors for personalized healthcare must operate within a tight energy envelope; addressing the ensuing challenge, we herein introduce an inexact and heterogeneous edge computing architecture, specifically tailored to the bio-DSP domain. We observe that bio-signal analysis applications present task-level parallelism, intensive computational hotspots and a high degree of resilience towards errors. These characteristics drive our new bio-DSP edge node architecture design composed of multiple processing cores, a Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA) accelerator, and hardware-software co-design support to become resilient to a non-zero probability of bit-flips at runtime. All these characteristics enable our new bio-DSP architecture to operate with an ultra-low voltage operating point. Indeed our results indicate that the energy benefits attained from the inclusion of all these characteristics in bio-DSP architectures are more than additive: task parallelism is harnessed both at the processor and the accelerator level, and the high tolerance of the CGRA towards voltage down-scaling is exploited to further decrease the IoT edge bio-DSP system energy envelope.},

abstract={The global ageing population puts a burden on healthcare systems not only from the point of view of cost-related aspects, but also from the senior patients' point of view who tend to be predominately empowered regarding their own health management, digitally-skilled and demanding for personalized health protocols and solutions. Silver Digital Patients can be defined as seniors that master improved abilities of using digital technology in their daily activities, including in monitoring their health, who prove increased interest in having access to the best healthcare to preserve as much as possible their independence and health. An active, decent and safe life for seniors is at its best in their own homes; therefore, a remote health monitoring represents the most appropriate way to smooth the disruptive degenerative age-related factors, together with the important benefit of relieving the expenditures for senior institutionalizations. In this respect, emerging senior-centered technologies have the potential to provide a reliable support for building the most appropriate healthcare provision and environment. Internet of Health Things (IoHT) is a concept for a great variety of devices connected to the Internet that are able to gather a huge amount of diverse data - like health or environmental parameters - in order to keep a close remote watch on the patient, to improve the diagnose of his/her health status and to establish a better preventative healthcare. Edge computing brings the potential of improving the performance and responsiveness of IoHT by allowing the real-time collected data to be pre-processed closer to the source, which can be extremely important for time-sensitive health data in order to identify and trigger anticipatory or reactive health actions. This paper presents a case study -" Non-invasive monitoring and health assessment of the elderly in a smart environment (RO-SmartAgeing)" project - that evaluates the opportunities brought by IoHT and edge computing for a monitoring application. The general objective of this project is to demonstrate the potential of some emerging technology for the positive transformation of how healthcare services are provided to the seniors and to healthcare provider. According to its current development state, a proposed IoHT-based architecture of the monitoring application and a data analytics demo for a health parameter is presented.},

abstract={Remote healthcare monitoring has exponentially grown over the past decade together with the increasing penetration of Internet of Things (IoT) platforms. IoT-based health systems help to improve the quality of healthcare services through real-time data acquisition and processing. However, traditional IoT architectures have some limitations. For instance, they cannot properly function in areas with poor or unstable Internet. Low power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies, including long-range communication protocols such as LoRa, are a potential candidate to overcome the lacking network infrastructure. Nevertheless, LPWANs have limited transmission bandwidth not suitable for high data rate applications such as fall detection systems or electrocardiography monitoring. Therefore, data processing and compression are required at the edge of the network. We propose a system architecture with integrated artificial intelligence that combines Edge and Fog computing, LPWAN technology, IoT and deep learning algorithms to perform health monitoring tasks. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this architecture via a use case of fall detection using recurrent neural networks. We have implemented a fall detection system from the sensor node and Edge gateway to cloud services and end-user applications. The system uses inertial data as input and achieves an average precision of over 90% and an average recall over 95% in fall detection.},

abstract={The future of healthcare systems is being shaped by incorporating emerged technological innovations to drive new models for patient care. By acquiring, integrating, analyzing, and exchanging medical data at different system levels, new practices can be introduced, offering a radical improvement to healthcare services. This article presents a novel smart and secure Healthcare system (ssHealth), which, leveraging advances in edge computing and blockchain technologies, permits epidemics discovering, remote monitoring, and fast emergency response. The proposed system also allows for secure medical data exchange among local healthcare entities, thus realizing the integration of multiple national and international entities and enabling the correlation of critical medical events for, for example, emerging epidemics management and control.

abstract={In the past decade, the revolution in miniaturization (microprocessors, batteries, cameras etc.) and manufacturing of new type of sensors resulted in a new regime of applications based on smart objects called IoT. Majority of such applications or services are to ease human life and/or to setup efficient processes in automated environments. However, this convenience is coming up with new challenges related to data security and human privacy. The objects in IoT are resource constrained devices and cannot implement a fool-proof security framework. These end devices work like eyes and ears to interact with the physical world and collect data for analytics to make expedient decisions. The storage and analysis of the collected data is done remotely using cloud computing. The transfer of data from IoT to the computing clouds can introduce privacy issues and network delays. Some applications need a real-time decision and cannot tolerate the delays and jitters in the network. Here, edge computing or fog computing plays its role to settle down the mentioned issues by providing cloud-like facilities near the end devices. In this paper, we discuss IoT, fog computing, the relationship between IoT and fog computing, their security issues and solutions by different researchers. We summarize attack surface related to each layer of this paradigm which will help to propose new security solutions to escalate it acceptability among end users. We also propose a risk-based trust management model for smart healthcare environment to cope with security and privacy-related issues in this highly un-predictable heterogeneous ecosystem.},

abstract={Several cities around the world are seeking to adopt the smart city concept to enhance the living quality of their residents and optimize city resources. Smart cities heavily rely on utilizing a number of technologies to improve the performance and services in healthcare, transportation, energy, education, and many others, while reducing costs and resource consumption. One of the promising technologies to support such efforts is the Cloud of Things (CoT). CoT can provide a platform for linking the cyber parts of the smart city that are executed on the cloud with the physical parts of the smart city including residents, vehicles, power grids, buildings, water networks, hospitals and other physical resources. Another technology that can be utilized for enhancing smart cities services is Fog Computing, which extends the traditional Cloud Computing paradigm to the edge of the network to enable better support for operating enhanced services. However, proper integration and efficient utilization of CoT and Fog Computing for smart cities is not an easy task. The paper discusses how the service-oriented middleware approach can help resolve some of the challenges of developing and operating smart city services using CoT and Fog Computing. In addition, this paper proposes a service-oriented middleware, called SmartCityWare, for effective integration and utilization of CoT and Fog Computing for smart cities.},

abstract={Reducing energy consumption in the fog computing environment is both a research and an operational challenge for the current research community and industry. There are several industries such as finance industry or healthcare industry that require a rich resource platform to process big data along with edge computing in fog architecture. As a result, sustainable computing in a fog server plays a key role in fog computing hierarchy. The energy consumption in fog servers depends on the allocation techniques of services (user requests) to a set of virtual machines (VMs). This service request allocation in a fog computing environment is a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard problem. In this paper, the scheduling of service requests to VMs is presented as a bi-objective minimization problem, where a tradeoff is maintained between the energy consumption and makespan. Specifically, this paper proposes a metaheuristic-based service allocation framework using three metaheuristic techniques, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), binary PSO, and bat algorithm. These proposed techniques allow us to deal with the heterogeneity of resources in the fog computing environment. This paper has validated the performance of these metaheuristic-based service allocation algorithms by conducting a set of rigorous evaluations.},

abstract={Improving the efficiency of healthcare systems is a top national interest worldwide. However, the need to deliver scalable healthcare services to patients while reducing costs is a challenging issue. Among the most promising approaches for enabling smart healthcare (s-health) are edge-computing capabilities and next-generation wireless networking technologies that can provide real-time and cost-effective patient remote monitoring. In this article, we present our vision of exploiting MEC for s-health applications. We envision a MEC-based architecture and discuss the benefits that it can bring to realize in-network and context-aware processing so that the s-health requirements are met. We then present two main functionalities that can be implemented leveraging such an architecture to provide efficient data delivery, namely, multimodal data compression and edge-based feature extraction for event detection. The former allows efficient and low distortion compression, while the latter ensures high-reliability and fast response in case of emergency applications. Finally, we discuss the main challenges and opportunities that edge computing could provide and possible directions for future research.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications give rise to an unprecedented amount of data that requires transfer, processing/analysis and storage. Often times, the norm is to maximize the capability of cloud computing services and infrastructure in running complex algorithms on data associated with IoT devices, in order to extract useful information, as well as harnessing its storage services. The downsides of employing cloud computing services include unacceptable latency, high storage cost, increased network bandwidth, etc. However, edge computing eliminates the problems of data communication latency of cloud computing, by processing data at its source. Thus, devices not continuously connected to the Internet can be used for data processing and analysis. Also due to the heterogeneous nature of devices used in data collection, the necessary data integration prior to analysis poses a challenge to developers of IoT solutions and products. The use of a middleware platform was harnessed to solve this problem. In this paper, we employ the use of an edge computing platform for analyzing data generated by IoT devices used in providing healthcare services. This is especially important as such services require real-time analytical results for health monitoring and diagnosis. The system depicted in this work is based on a proposed patient-centric architecture for remotely monitoring patients, and comprises of a biosensor, a smartphone, and an edge analytics platform for data analysis. The biosensor (heart rate sensor) used for this work collects physiological data from the patient and sends it via Bluetooth to the smartphone, which hosts a mobile application, “HealthMate”, that pre-processes the sensor data, transfers it to the edge computing platform server, Kaa server, for further data analysis and storage. The analyzed sensor data is sent back to the mobile application on the smartphone for real-time visualization if required.},

These cities are looking to apply the smart city concept to improve sustainability, quality of life for residents, and economic development. The smart city concept depends on employing a wide range of advanced technologies to improve the performance of various services and activities such as transportation, energy, healthcare, and education, while at the same time improve the city's resources utilization and initiate new business opportunities. One of the promising technologies to support such efforts is the big data technology. Effective and intelligent use of big data accumulated over time in various sectors can offer many advantages to enhance decision making in smart cities. In this paper we identify the different types of decision making processes involved in smart cities. Then we propose a service-oriented architecture to support big data analytics for decision making in smart cities. This architecture allows for integrating different technologies such as fog and cloud computing to support different types of analytics and decision-making operations needed to effectively utilize available big data. It provides different functions and capabilities to use big data and provide smart capabilities as services that the architecture supports.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) aims to bring every object such as smart cameras, wearable devices, environmental sensors, home appliances, and vehicles online. These “Things” generate an unprecedented amount of data and transmit it to the cloud for long-term processing and because existing data processing or analytics approaches are designed to deal with massive data and not real-time data, having millions of “Things” generating and transferring data to the cloud is neither scalable nor suitable for real-time decision making. Therefore, the current infrastructure will not be able to handle the massive volume of data that will be generated by these devices, hence a new paradigm known as Fog Computing has been proposed. Fog computing extends the cloud platform model by providing computing resources at the edge of the network which results in better performance. However, researchers have raised challenges such as security and privacy, which arise from IoT-based Fog computing environments. Although technologies and solutions enabling connectivity and data delivery are growing rapidly, not enough attention has been given to the security of these computing paradigms and the associated IoT devices. Hence, this paper investigates and compare Fog Orchestrators that enable security in fog computing and further investigate the security techniques used in IoT-based Fog computing environments. This discussion shows that due to better performance brought by Fog Orchestrators, security and privacy models can be implemented in IoT-based fog environments.},

abstract={Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), a new concept that emerged about a year ago, integrating the IT and the Telecom worlds will have a great impact on the openness of the Telecom market. Furthermore, the virtualization revolution that has enabled the Cloud computing success will benefit the Telecom domain, which in turn will be able to support the IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service). The main objective of MEC solution is the export of some Cloud capabilities to the user's proximity decreasing the latency, augmenting the available bandwidth and decreasing the load on the core network. On the other hand, the Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of the future, has benefited from the proliferation in the mobile phones' usage. Many mobile applications have been developed to connect a world of things (wearables, home automation systems, sensors, RFID tags etc.) to the Internet. Even if it is not a complete solution for a scalable IoT architecture but the time sensitive IoT applications (e-healthcare, real time monitoring, etc.) will profit from the MEC architecture.

Smart healthcare sensors and IoT enabled medical devices exchange data and collaborate with other smart devices without human interaction to securely transmit collected sensitive healthcare data towards the server nodes. Alongside data communications, security and privacy is also quite challenging to securely aggregate and transmit healthcare data towards Fog and cloud servers. We explored the existing surveys to identify a gap in literature that a survey of fog-assisted secure healthcare data collection schemes is yet contributed in literature. This paper presents a survey of different data collection and secure transmission schemes where Fog computing based architectures are considered. A taxonomy is presented to categorize the schemes.

abstract={This paper introduces an edge-computing based Complex Event Processing (CEP) architecture for Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) which is an important issue in the context of remote healthcare. In this architecture, the detection of complex events, that may indicate impending health problems, is performed on a mobile device that receives data from sensors attached to the body of a patient. The detected complex events are sent to a back-end hospital server running on a cloud for further processing. Current state-of-the-art RPM techniques use the mobile device as an IoT gateway agent to forward data streams from health sensors to a remote hospital server where complex events are detected. A drawback of this existing methodology is that the mobile phone always needs to remain connected to the hospital server. Also, the mobile network consumption is increased while transferring large volumes of sensor data streams thus leading to an increase in the user cost. Additionally, it leads to an increase in the workload at the hospital server that serves multiple patients. This research investigates a mobile device based CEP system for addressing these issues and demonstrates its viability through a proof-of-concept prototype. A thorough performance analysis is performed using a synthetic workload that provides insights into system scalability and the relationship between system/workload parameters and performance.},

Such services could supplement the shortage of staff in primary healthcare centers thereby reducing the burden on healthcare service providers. The enormous amount of data created from such services could also be utilized for planning future therapies by studying recovery cycles of existing patients.

abstract={The recent advancements in ubiquitous sensing powered by Wireless Computing Technologies (WCT) and Cloud Computing Services (CCS) have introduced a new thinking ability amongst researchers and healthcare professionals for building secure and connected healthcare systems. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare services further brings in several challenges with it, mainly including encrypted communication through vulnerable wireless medium, authentication and access control algorithms and ownership transfer schemes (important patient information). Major concern of such giant connected systems lies in creating the data handling strategies which is collected from the billions of heterogeneous devices distributed across the hospital network. Besides, the resource constrained nature of IoT would make these goals difficult to achieve. Motivated by aforementioned deliberations, this paper introduces a novel approach in designing a security framework for edge-computing based connected healthcare systems. An efficient, multi-factor access control and ownership transfer mechanism for edge-computing based futuristic healthcare applications is the core of proposed framework. Data scalability is achieved by employing distributed approach for clustering techniques that analyze and aggregate voluminous data acquired from heterogeneous devices individually before it transits the to the cloud. Moreover, data/device ownership transfer scheme is considered to be the first time in its kind. During ownership transfer phase, medical server facilitates user to transfer the patient information/ device ownership rights to the other registered users. In order to avoid the existing mistakes, we propose a formal and informal security analysis, that ensures the resistance towards most common IoT attacks such as insider attack, denial of distributed service (DDoS) attack and traceability attacks.},

abstract={Cloud-based human services administration with the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is an emerging model for supporting medicinal services that are convenient for urban regions and helpless people that uses the advanced correspondences. The Healthcare things were deployed here to give flexible chances to change all the wellbeing information into useful, customized wellbeing bits of knowledge, and that will be of greater help to accomplish the health outside the community where the health departments are not in operation. This model of social insurance Web administration acts like a living body, that will help managing the doors by running in cloud foundation to associate patients and suppliers at any place to improve the atmosphere of the health centers with the IoHT, which was going about as a focal nervous system for this model that will help the patients by estimating essential measurements, continually logging their wellbeing information, and report any variations from the norm to the pertinent social insurance supplier. In any emergency case, the urge to save the patients and to protect them timely, this model plays the vital role to keep up their fulfillment and trust in the offered administrations. With the expanding number of cases for protection ruptures on social insurance information, various nations and companies have given security laws and guidelines to characterize the prescribed procedures for the security of individual wellbeing. The medical coverage transportability, possibility act and the protection standards are built up by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which remain as instances of such guideline structures.},

abstract={Recently, the design and implementation of new healthcare systems have gained an interest in both industry and academia. The amalgamation between the Internet of Things, cloud, edge computing, and big data helps the proliferation of new scenarios for smart medical services and applications. Deep learning is currently paying a lot of attention for its utilization with big healthcare data. To this end, the main objective of this study is to propose a Deep Learning H2O (DLH2O) framework for improving the performance and selection of the optimal features to predict emergency cases. The proposed DLH2O framework consists of data preprocessing layer, feature selection layer and deep learning layer. The DLH2O framework aims to find the optimal subset of features and minimize the error of the classification through a proposed new variant of the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) called ACP-WOA. The proposed changes have been done on the following parameters a, a2, A, and C which should affect both exploration and exploitation of WOA. The experiments conducted in order to test the validity of DLH2O Framework. In regard to the datasets, five experiments are performed for this purpose. The results demonstrate the superiority of ACP-WOA compared to the other state-of-the-art meta-heuristic algorithms in terms of time, error, and scalability. The proposed ACP-WOA is also tested on CEC2017 benchmark functions and proves its superiority over WOA in terms of accuracy.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has been growing exponentially in the commercial market in recent years. It is also a fact that people hold one or more computing devices at home. Many of them have been developed to operate through internet connectivity with cloud computing technologies that result in the demand for fast, robust, and secure services. In most cases, the lack of these services makes difficult the transfer of data to fulfill the devices' purposes. Under these conditions, an intermediate layer or middleware is needed to process, filter, and send data through a more efficient alternative. This paper presents the adaptive solution of a middleware architecture as an intermediate layer between smart devices and cloud computing to enhance the management of the heterogeneity of data provining from IoT devices. The proposed middleware provides easy configuration, adaptability, and bearability for different environments. Finally, this solution has been implemented in the healthcare domain, in which IoT solutions are deployed into Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) environments.},

abstract={The rapid growth of the healthcare industry has been revolutionized by the emergence of medical sensors and mobile devices. These technological advances are part of the Internet of Things (IoT) where these devices are interconnected to exchange data to improve the delivery of various medical services including patient monitoring. Although IoT is considered a promising paradigm in healthcare, the security of patients' data is still a significant issue that should be thoroughly addressed. Access control is one of the main security mechanisms that should be applied to healthcare to limit access to patients' data to only authorized individuals. In this paper, we propose a distributed fog-based access control architecture for healthcare. In this design, the access control functions are distributed to bring policy decision and policy information mechanisms to the edges of the network near to the end nodes. This approach increases availability and decreases latency.},

abstract={Pervasive and ubiquitous computing services have recently been under focus of not only the research community, but developers as well. Prevailing wireless sensor networks (WSNs), Internet of Things (IoT), and healthcare related services have made it difficult to handle all the data in an efficient and effective way and create more useful services. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Therefore, amalgamation of cloud computing with IoTs, termed as Cloud of Things (CoT) has recently been under discussion in research arena. CoT provides ease of management for the growing media content and other data. Besides this, features like: ubiquitous access, service creation, service discovery, and resource provisioning play a significant role, which comes with CoT. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time response. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data is to be uploaded in the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, Fog computing plays an important role. Fog resides between underlying IoTs and the cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. For this purpose, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework for IoTs, which we provide in this paper. Our model covers the issues of resource prediction, customer type based resource estimation and reservation, advance reservation, and pricing for new and existing IoT customers, on the basis of their characteristics. The implementation was done using Java, while the model was evaluated using CloudSim toolkit. The results and discussion show the validity and performance of our system.},

abstract={The HL7 standard was initially designed to enable interoperability of healthcare information within large hospitals. HL7's focus has recently been extended to regional healthcare cloud infrastructures but not yet reached the lightweight fog infrastructures emerging from niche healthcare areas such as body area networks (BANs) and the massive flow of personal medical records resulting from off-the-shelf e-health devices and networks. This paper addresses the issue of interoperability between fog and cloud computing platforms by i) proposing a framework for a standardized exchange of information between healthcare entities ii) designing and implementing a software tool to be integrated into medical data dissemination protocols to ensure interoperability and iii) evaluating the impact of the software tool on the transport of data when exchanging healthcare information using “in-band” and “out-band” transport over the IEEE802.15.4/ZigBee and WiFi protocols. Our results reveal that, for the lightweight devices used by fog infrastructures, “out-band” transport over WiFi with edge data translation into HL7 records is a better option than “in-band” transport.},

abstract={The popularity of wearable devices and smartphones has fueled the development of Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR), which provides immersive experiences over the real world using techniques, such as computer vision and deep learning. However, the hardware-specific MAR is costly and heavy, and the App-based MAR requires an additional download and installation and it also lacks cross-platform ability. These limitations hamper the pervasive promotion of MAR. This paper argues that mobile Web AR (MWAR) holds the potential to become a practical and pervasive solution that can effectively scale to millions of end-users because MWAR can be developed as a lightweight, cross-platform, and low-cost solution for end-to-end delivery of MAR. The main challenges for making MWAR a reality lie in the low efficiency for dense computing in Web browsers, a large delay for real-time interactions over mobile networks, and the lack of standardization. The good news is that the newly emerging 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) cellular networks can mitigate these issues to some extent via techniques such as network slicing, device-to-device communication, and mobile edge computing. In this paper, we first give an overview of the challenges and opportunities of MWAR in the 5G era. Then we describe our design and development of a generic service-oriented framework (called MWAR5) to provide a scalable, flexible, and easy to deploy MWAR solution. We evaluate the performance of our MWAR5 system in an actually deployed 5G trial network under the collaborative configurations, which shows encouraging results. Moreover, we also share the experiences and insights from our development and deployment, including some exciting future directions of MWAR over 5G and B5G networks.},

abstract={Blockchain, as the backbone technology of the current popular Bitcoin digital currency, has become a promising decentralized data management framework. Although blockchain has been widely adopted in many applications (e.g., finance, healthcare, and logistics), its application in mobile services is still limited. This is due to the fact that blockchain users need to solve preset proof-of-work puzzles to add new data (i.e., a block) to the blockchain. Solving the proof of work, however, consumes substantial resources in terms of CPU time and energy, which is not suitable for resource-limited mobile devices. To facilitate blockchain applications in future mobile Internet of Things systems, multiple access mobile edge computing appears to be an auspicious solution to solve the proof-of-work puzzles for mobile users. We first introduce a novel concept of edge computing for mobile blockchain. Then we introduce an economic approach for edge computing resource management. Moreover, a prototype of mobile edge computing enabled blockchain systems is presented with experimental results to justify the proposed concept.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining increasing popularity. Overwhelming volumes of data are generated by IoT devices. Those data after analytics provide significant information that could greatly benefit IoT applications. Different from traditional applications, IoT applications, such as environmental monitoring, smart navigation, and smart healthcare come with new requirements, such as mobility, real-time response, and location awareness. However, traditional cloud computing paradigm cannot satisfy these demands due to centralized processing and being far away from local devices. Hence, edge computing was introduced to perform data processing and storage in the edge of networks, which is closer to data sources than cloud computing, thus efficient and location-aware. Unfortunately, edge computing brings new security and privacy challenges when applied to data analytics. The literature still lacks a thorough review on the recent advances in secure data analytics in edge computing. In this paper, we first introduce the concept and features of edge computing, and then propose a number of requirements for its secure data analytics by analyzing potential security threats in edge computing. Furthermore, we give a comprehensive review on the pros and cons of the existing works on data analytics in edge computing based on our proposed requirements. Based on our literature survey, we highlight current open issues and propose future research directions.},

Real-time monitoring based on the information gathered from the connected `things' provides large scale connectivity and a greater insight into patient care, individual habits and routines. While the benefits of introducing this paradigm into healthcare are conspicuous, the underlying security vulnerabilities and threats of the infrastructure and devices cannot go unaddressed.

abstract={With the rapid development of sensing and communication capacities, wearable technology, one of the most significant trends in the mobile computing evolution, has been changing our daily life. Wearable devices generally require a powerful local hub to replenish computing capacities for advanced features. However, it is inconvenient to carry the local hub in many situations, even though more and more wearable devices are equipped with a WiFi/cellular interface, enabling them to exchange data with the local hub through the Internet, However, this results in long response time and functional limitations. To overcome the restriction of a physical local hub, we propose a VLH solution, which utilizes network equipment nearby (e.g., a WiFi hotspot or cellular base station) as the local hub. In this article, we first describe the operating mechanism of a local hub and give an overview of the VLH system. Then we describe the system design of the VLH, including the container-based virtualization and the modified microservice architecture which enables remote function module sharing in the fog-computing environment. We then propose an algorithm to deal with function module allocation and sharing decisions. Finally, we demonstrate and verify the effectiveness and practicality of VLH via both simulations under large-scale network setting and real-world prototype implementation.},

abstract={The recent development of big data-oriented wireless technologies in terms of emerging 5G, edge computing, interconnected devices of the Internet of Things (IoT), and data analytics, as well as techniques, have enabled connected healthcare services for a happier and healthier life. Although, the quality of the healthcare services can be enhanced through big data-oriented wireless technologies, however, the challenges remain for not considering emotional care, especially for children, elderly, and mentally ill people. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware connected healthcare system using a powerful emotion detection module. Different IoT devices are used to capture speech and image signals of a patient in a smart home scenario. These signals are used as the input to the emotion detection module. Speech and image signals are processed separately, and classification scores using these signals are fused to produce a final score to take a decision about the emotion. If the emotion is detected as pain, caregivers can visit the patient. Several experiments were performed to validate the proposed system, and good accuracies, up to 99.87%, were achieved for emotion detection. The proposed framework would greatly contribute personalized and seamless emotion-aware healthcare services toward 5G.},

abstract={The use of machine learning modeling techniques enables smart IoT applications in geo-distributed infrastructures such as in the areas of Industry 4.0, smart cities, autonomous driving, and telemedicine. The data for these models is continuously emitted by sensor-equipped devices. It is usually unlabeled and commonly has dynamically-changing data distribution, which impedes the learning process. However, many critical applications such as telemedicine require highly accurate models and human supervision. Therefore, online supervised learning is often utilized, but its application remains challenging as it requires continuous labeling by experts, which is expensive. To reduce the cost, active learning (AL) strategies are used for efficient data selection and labeling. In this paper we propose a novel AL framework for IoT applications, which employs data selection strategies throughout the multiple layers of distributed IoT architectures. This enables an improved utilization of the available resources and reduces costs. The results from the evaluation using classification and regression tasks and synthetic as well as real-world datasets in multiple settings show that the use of multilayer AL can significantly reduce communication, expert costs, and energy, without a loss in model performance. We believe that this study motivates the development of new techniques that employ selective sampling strategies on data streams to optimize the resource usage in IoT architectures.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) represents the most promising Internet of Things (IoT) application due to its relevance in the elders healthcare and improvement of their quality of life. Recently, the AAL IoT ecosystem has been enriched with promising technologies such as edge computing, which has demonstrated to be the best approach to overcome the demanding requirements of AAL and healthcare services by providing a reduction of the amount of data to transfer to the cloud, an improvement of the response time, and quality of experience. Also, the deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies at the edge provides intelligence to improve the decision making timely. However, this approach has been scarcely studied in AAL scenarios and the few proposals based on deploying machine learning models at the edge lack efficiency, security, mechanisms of resource management, service management, and deployment, as well as a real and experimental AAL scenario. For these reasons, this paper proposes an innovative edge gateway architecture to support the deployment of deep learning (DL) models in AAL and healthcare scenarios efficiently. To do so, we have added a predictive analytics module to deploy the models. Since AI technologies demand more resources, a container-based virtualization technology is employed on the edge gateway to manage the limited resources, and provide security and lifecycle services management. The edge gateway performance was evaluated deploying a DL-based fall detection application on it. As a result, our approach improves the inference time compared to that based on the cloud in 34 seconds and to similar approaches in 8 seconds.},

abstract={Mobile edge computing helps healthcare Internet of Things (IoT) devices with energy harvesting provide satisfactory quality of experiences for computation intensive applications. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based privacy-aware offloading scheme to help healthcare IoT devices protect both the user location privacy and the usage pattern privacy. More specifically, this scheme enables a healthcare IoT device to choose the offloading rate that improves the computation performance, protects user privacy, and saves the energy of the IoT device without being aware of the privacy leakage, IoT energy consumption, and edge computation model. This scheme uses transfer learning to reduce the random exploration at the initial learning process and applies a Dyna architecture that provides simulated offloading experiences to accelerate the learning process. A post-decision state learning method uses the known channel state model to further improve the offloading performance. We provide the performance bound of this scheme regarding the privacy level, the energy consumption, and the computation latency for three typical healthcare IoT offloading scenarios. Simulation results show that this scheme can reduce the computation latency, save the energy consumption, and improve the privacy level of the healthcare IoT device compared with the benchmark scheme.},

abstract={Most cloud-based applications utilize a cloud server to handle data produced by various terminal devices, including smart devices and wearable devices. The above model has big negative effect on user experience. Furthermore, the emergence of some new computing applications, including automatic drive and virtual reality, has become possible because of availability of abundant cloud resources. Nonetheless, the delay-sensitive applications have strict response time requirements. The existing computing model does not have capability to meet the above demand. Based on the above phenomenon, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been suggested to bring cloud resources, such as computation and storage resources, to the edge network. Now, MEC is considered as a good method to reduce the workload on the cloud server and to reduce response time for mobile users. In this paper, the definition of the MEC is presented. Then, we discuss several typical applications of MEC. Also, we describe some key research challenges in MEC scenario. In the end, we highlight the critical points and conclude this paper.},

abstract={Automatically recognizing emotions of patients can be a good facilitator of a connected healthcare framework. It can give automatic feedback to the stakeholders of the healthcare industry about patients' states and satisfaction levels. In this article, we propose an automatic audio-visual emotion recognition system in a connected healthcare framework. The system uses a 2D CNN model for the speech modality and a 3D CNN model for the visual modality. For the speech signal, preprocessing is done to extract the PS-PA feature vector. The features from the two CNN models are blended by two ELM networks. The first ELM is trained with gender-specific data, while the other one is trained with emotion-specific data. The proposed system is evaluated using three databases, and the experiments prove the success of the system. In the healthcare framework, we use edge computing prior to intensive-processing cloud computing. In the edge computing, we realize edge caching, which can store the CNN model parameters and thereby perform the testing fast.},

abstract={Mobile edge computing (MEC) provides a promising approach to significantly reduce network operational cost and improve quality of service (QoS) of mobile users by pushing computation resources to the network edges, and enables a scalable Internet of Things (IoT) architecture for time-sensitive applications (e-healthcare, real-time monitoring, and so on.). However, the mobility of mobile users and the limited coverage of edge servers can result in significant network performance degradation, dramatic drop in QoS, and even interruption of ongoing edge services; therefore, it is difficult to ensure service continuity. Service migration has great potential to address the issues, which decides when or where these services are migrated following user mobility and the changes of demand. In this paper, two conceptions similar to service migration, i.e., live migration for data centers and handover in cellular networks, are first discussed. Next, the cutting-edge research efforts on service migration in MEC are reviewed, and a devisal of taxonomy based on various research directions for efficient service migration is presented. Subsequently, a summary of three technologies for hosting services on edge servers, i.e., virtual machine, container, and agent, is provided. At last, open research challenges in service migration are identified and discussed.},

abstract={The number of zero-day attacks has been exponentially increasing due to a variety of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) protocols. Many centralized-based techniques have been introduced to identify malicious activities in IoT environments. However, these techniques have suffered including a high latency to satisfy IoT requirements. This paper proposes a fog-based attack detection (FBAD) framework using an ensemble of online sequential extreme learning machine (EOS-ELM) for efficiently detecting malicious activities. We indicate a high-level view of the efficient proposed framework for deploying the distributed attack detection technique in fog computing due to high accuracy and low latency, as it is closer to the IoT devices at the network edge. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our framework with other existing approaches including ELM and OS-ELM. The results of the experiment demonstrate that distributed architecture outperforms centralized architecture in terms of the detection time and classification accuracy.},
