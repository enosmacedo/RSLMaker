abstract={In the last few years, the Internet of Things (IOT), as a new disruptive technology, has gradually changed the world. With the prosperous development of the mobile Internet and the rapid growth of the Internet of Things, various new applications continue to emerge, such as mobile payment, face recognition, wearable devices, driverless, VR/AR, etc. Although the computing power of mobile terminals is getting higher and the traditional cloud computing model has higher computing power, it is often accompanied by higher latency and cannot meet the needs of users. In order to reduce user delay to improve user experience, and at the same time reduce network load to a certain extent, edge computing, as an application of IOT, came into being. In view of the new architecture after dating edge computing, this paper focuses on the task offloading in edge computing, from task migration in multi-user scenarios and edge server resource management expansion, and proposes a multi-agent load balancing distribution based on deep reinforcement learning DTOMALB, a distributed task allocation algorithm, can perform a reasonable offload method for this scenario to improve user experience and balance resource utilization. Simulations show that the algorithm has a certain adaptability compared to the traditional algorithm in the scenario of multi-user single cell, and reduces the complexity of the algorithm compared to the centralized algorithm, and reduces the average response delay of the overall user. And balance the load of each edge computing server, improve the robustness and scalability of the system. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Digital revolution is characterized by the convergence of technologies — from cloud computing to edge/fog computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data, Intelligent Internet of Things (IoT), and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) — that is blurring the lines between physical and digital worlds. In this context, the IoT tsunami, the ubiquitous adoption of intelligent connected devices, and the public embracement of DLT, of which blockchain is a popular example, are increasingly becoming an integral feature of many modern systems, particularly, IoT-based smart and connected healthcare. Although the IoT and DLT/blockchain are two very different technologies and distinct from each other, the fusion of blockchain and IoT technologies is an unprecedented paradigm shift that is expected to disrupt both current and future systems in various fields. Blockchain has exactly what is needed to fix the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of IoT. It solves the security fault line among intelligent IoT where most of the IoT devices are connected to each other through the public trustless environment. Moreover, its distributed peer-to-peer nature can address the shortcomings of client/server models in Cloud-IoT solutions. Although the convergence of IoT and blockchain (Blockchain-IoT) can potentially tackle major shortcomings of today's solutions, its adoption is still in infancy, suffering from various issues and thus there is a necessity to address significant challenges including scalability, consensus algorithms, data privacy, efficiency, availability, storage, interoperability, and standardization, among others. In addition, there is no consensus towards any reference model or best practices that specify how blockchain should be utilized in IoT. This paper aims to present a holistic reference architecture as well as fundamentals, recent advancements, promises, and challenges in order to foster the investigations on cutting-edge research and allowing one to contribute to advancing the convergence of blockchain and IoT. © Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The popularization of the Internet of Things has opened opportunities for applications in various economic sectors, allowing them to monitor and control various types of environments. However, with the increasing number of data sent by devices, applications have come to demand increased availability and Internet bandwidth, but these demands are still a bottleneck in regions farther from large urban centers and with less economic development. In this work, we examine how bandwidth limitations can affect cloud-based applications and propose a Fog Computing-based Control-as-a-Service architecture to dynamically process events in the context of Internet of Things and Smart Environments. The architecture is composed of a Rules Engine and a Complex Event Processor based on Supervisory Control techniques for Discrete Event Systems. The Rules Engine allows defining dynamic rules conditioning control from different types of input data. The Complex Event Processor with automatic synthesis and reconfiguration capability allows performing control actions to established rules. Finally, we present scenarios where this solution can be applied, such as Smart Farm, Smart Home, Smart City, and Smart Healthcare. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Cross-modal applications that elaborately integrate audio, video, and haptic streams will become the mainstream of the eHealth systems. However, existing stream schedulers usually fail to simultaneously meet the cross-modal transmission requests in terms of low latency, high reliability, high throughput, and low complexity. To circumvent this dilemma, this article proposes a general cross-modal stream scheduling scheme by fully taking advantage of the characteristics of different modal streams and their underlying temporal, spatial, and semantic relevance. Specifically, we first propose a hierarchical stream category framework, in which the transmission priority of the modal stream instead of the data flow can be flexibly settled. Next, we design a series of modal-aware stream scheduling schemes by jointly making use of the network slice and mobile edge computing to achieve the tradeoff among the various metrics. Importantly, the transmission strategy can be adjusted adaptively to realize the optimal resource allocation. Subsequently, we analyze the relationship among the user experience, multi-modal impact, and stream scheduling through investigating the interacted impacts among the different modal streams, then develop a user experience based scheduling switch strategy to improve the application generality and reduce the performance fluctuation. Numerical objective and subjective results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed cross-modal scheduling scheme. © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), an application of Internet of Things (IoT), is addressing countless limitation of traditional health-care systems such as quality of patient care, healthcare costs, shortage of medical staff and inadequate medical supplies in an efficient manner. With the use of the IoMT systems, there are unparalleled benefits that are enhancing the quality and efficiency of treatments and thereby are improving patients health. However, the 2018 Ransomware cyber-attack on Indiana hospital system exposed the critical fault-lines among IoMT environment. The gravity and frequency of cyber-attacks are expanding at an alarming rate. Motivated from aforementioned challenges, we propose an ensemble learning and fog-cloud architecture-driven cyber-attack detection framework for IoMT networks. The ensemble design, combines Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest as first-level individual learners. In the next level, the classification results are used by XGBoost for identifying normal and attack instances. Second, for dynamic and heterogeneous networks such as IoMT, fog, and cloud, we present a deployment architecture for the proposed framework as, Software as a Service (SaaS) in fog side and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in cloud side. Further, most of the existing work is evaluated using KDD CUP99 or NSL-KDD dataset. These datasets lack modern IoMT-based attacks. Therefore, the proposed model uses a realistic dataset namely, ToN-IoT which is collected from a heterogeneous and large-scale IoT network. The experimental result shows that the proposed framework can achieve detection rate of 99.98%, accuracy of 96.35%, and can reduce false alarm rate up to 5.59%. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={With the advent of new technologies and the fast pace of human life, patients today require a sophisticated and advanced smart healthcare framework that is tailored to suit their individual health requirements. Along with 5G and state-of-the-art smart Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, edge computing provides intelligent, real-time healthcare solutions that satisfy energy consumption and latency criteria. Earlier surveys on smart healthcare systems were centered on cloud and fog computing architectures, security, and authentication, and the types of sensors and devices used in edge computing frameworks. They did not focus on the healthcare IoT applications deployed within edge computing architectures. The first purpose of this study is to analyze the existing and evolving edge computing architectures and techniques for smart healthcare and recognize the demands and challenges of different application scenarios. We examine edge intelligence that targets health data classification with the tracking and identification of vital signs using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. This study also presents a comprehensive analysis of the use of cutting-edge artificial intelligence-based classification and prediction techniques employed for edge intelligence. Even with its many advantages, edge intelligence poses challenges related to computational complexity and security. To offer a higher quality of life to patients, potential research recommendations for improving edge computing services for healthcare are identified in this study. This study also offers a brief overview of the general usage of IoT solutions in edge platforms for medical treatment and healthcare. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Today’s global marketplace for Internet of Things (IoT) remains fiercely competitive within the healthcare sector. This can be attributed to many exciting achievements. It is expected to have a positive influence on all aspects of healthcare such as reducing prevalence and incidence of chronic conditions, improving the patient treatment and lowering in per capita healthcare costs, resulting from the forecasted increases in the adoption of remote monitoring devices. These smart devices along with wearables and Internet-connected sensors are expected to generate a great amount of data every second. However, the present model used to handle these unprecedented data named as cloud computing becomes inadequate. The solution must be seen in fog computing. The strong need of this model was mainly driven by a growing demand for real-time analysis and low latency. Motivated from these facts, this paper defines fog computing for IoT-driven smart healthcare while comparing it with cloud computing. It also presents an architecture of fog-based healthcare system containing three layers: edge, fog, and cloud. Finally, this paper highlights opportunities and top challenges facing smart healthcare organizations in the coming years. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

However, according to unstructured and critical healthcare data nature, higher Quality of Service (QoS) is considered a major challenge over designing such systems for providing faster responses and data-specific complicated analytics services. Considering the mentioned issues, this particular paper aims to provide agenda of a five-layered heterogeneous model with IoHT framework based on cloud, fog, and mist along with the capability of routing offline/batch mode data and efficiently handling either instantaneously or real-time. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Recently, an increasing number of works start investigating the combination of fog computing and electronic health (ehealth) applications. However, there are still numerous unresolved issues worth to be explored. For instance, there is a lack of investigation on the disease prediction in fog environment and only limited studies show, how the Quality of Service (QoS) levels of fog services and the data stream mining techniques influence each other to improve the disease prediction performance (e.g., accuracy and time efficiency). To address these issues, we propose a fog-based framework for disease prediction based on Medical sensor data streams, named FogMed. This framework aims to improve the disease prediction accuracy by achieving two objectives: QoS guarantee of fog services and anomaly prediction of Medical data streams. We build a virtual FogMed environment and conduct comprehensive experiments on the public ECG dataset to validate the performance of FogMed. The experiment results show that it performs better than the cloud computing model for processing tasks with different complexities in terms of time efficiency. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing rapidly in today’s world. A big challenge nowadays is the large volume of data generated between WSN and the cloud infrastructure. Fog computing is a new technology that is an extension to the cloud where processing is performed at the edge of the network, reducing latency and traffic as well. Because of its structure, it has a high demand in healthcare applications, smart homes, supply chain management, smart cities, and intelligent transportation system. Nano data centers (nDCs) are called the tiny computers at the edge of the network. Load balancing is achieved by the current fog architecture. User request allocation technique plays a vital role in fog server energy consumption. The allocation of the user request task to fog servers in a fog environment is a difficult (NP-hard) problem. This article proposes a task consolidation for energy saving by reducing the unused nDCs in a fog computing environment and maximizing CPU utilization. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

In this paper, we present iGateLink, an open-source Android library easing the development of Android applications acting as a gateway between IoT devices and edge/fog/cloud computing environments. Thanks to its pluggable design, modules providing connectivity with a number of devices acting as data sources or fog/cloud frameworks can be easily reused for different applications. Using iGateLink in two case studies replicating previous works in the healthcare and image processing domains, the library proved to be effective in adapting to different scenarios and speeding up development of gateway applications, as compared to the use of conventional methods. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The increasing use of smart devices connected to the Internet has driven the technological industry and academia to propose applications that allow us to live in a more secure and autonomous way. However, technological advancement has been accompanied by increasingly demanding time requirements, such as fast processing, low latency, and presentation of data within acceptable times. Therefore, we propose in this article a model and computational architecture for a distributed IoT environment with fog computing configuration for a healthcare application. The goal of our proposal is to provide the correct use of specialized tools so that it is possible to indicate a time constraint and thus process and present the data near real-time. We carried out the implementation of the proposed architecture and generated preliminary results that presented reports, through graphs and tables, of the current situation of the assisted user, as well as generating alerts of abnormal situations. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the increasing popularity of smart user equipments (UEs), numerous exciting wireless big data services are coming into life. However, due to the constraints of physical size, UEs are struggling with limited battery energy and computation capacity. In this paper, we propose a multi-user vehicle-aided multi-access edge computing (MEC) network architecture by deploying parked vehicles as the temporary computation service providers. A dynamic pricing strategy is proposed to minimize the energy consumption of UEs under the constraints on quality of service while maximize mobile service providers (MSPs)’ revenue. A differential evolution (DE) algorithm is proposed to determine UE's fine-grained offloading decision. Moreover, a Q-learning algorithm is utilized to assist the DE algorithm in selecting the proper unit service price. The results show that the proposed dynamic pricing strategy can achieve better performance than the fixed pricing strategy and the differential pricing strategy regarding the overall cumulative cost. In addition, the proposed approach promises higher resource efficiency in comparison with all local execution and random offloading algorithms. The results obtained in this paper can be applied to design the future healthcare service pricing scheme of the IoT-based intelligent system. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Currently, matching the incoming Internet of Things applications to the current state of computing and networking resources of a mobile edge orchestrator (MEO) is critical for providing the high quality of service while temporally and spatially changing the incoming workload. However, MEO needs to scale its capacity concerning a large number of devices to avoid task failure and to reduce service time. To cope with this issue, we propose MEO with fuzzy-based logic that splits tasks from mobile devices and maps them onto the cloud and edge servers to reduce the latency of handling these tasks and task failures. A fuzzy-based MEO handles the multi-criteria decision-making process to decide where the offloaded task should run by considering multiple parameters in the same framework. Our approach selects the appropriate host for task execution and finds the optimal task-splitting strategy. Compared to the existing approaches, the service time using our proposal can achieve up to 7.6%, 22.6%, 38.9%, and 51.8% performance gains for augmented reality, healthcare, compute-intensive, and infotainment applications, respectively. © 1997-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Deep learning has been becoming a promising focus in data mining research. With deep learning techniques, researchers can discover deep properties and features of events from quantitative mobile sensor data. However, many data sources are geographically separated and have strict privacy, security, and regulatory constraints. Upon releasing the privacy-sensitive data, these data sources generally no longer physically possess their data and cannot interfere with the way their personal data being used. Therefore, it is necessary to explore distributed data mining architecture which is able to conduct consensus learning based on needs. Accordingly, we propose a distributed deep learning optimized system which contains a cloud server and multiple smartphone devices with computation capabilities and each device is served as a personal mobile data hub for enabling mobile computing while preserving data privacy. The proposed system keeps the private data locally in smartphones, shares trained parameters, and builds a global consensus model. The feasibility and usability of the proposed system are evaluated by three experiments and related discussion. The experimental results show that the proposed distributed deep learning system can reconstruct the behavior of centralized training. We also measure the cumulative network traffic in different scenarios and show that the partial parameter sharing strategy does not only preserve the performance of the trained model but also can reduce network traffic. User data privacy is protected on two levels. First, local private training data do not need to be shared with other people and the user has full control of their personal training data all the time. Second, only a small fraction of trained gradients of the local model are selected for sharing, which further reduces the risk of information leaking. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless and mobile health applications promote the development of smart healthcare. Effective diagnosis and feedbacks of remote health data pose significant challenges due to streaming data, high noise, network latency and user privacy. Therefore, we explore efficient edge and cloud design to maintain electrocardiogram classification performance while reducing the communication cost. These contributions include: (1) We introduce a hybrid smart medical architecture named edge convolutional neural networks (EdgeCNN) that balances the capability of edge and cloud computing to address the issue for agile learning of healthcare data from IoT devices. (2) We present an effective deep learning model for electrocardiogram (ECG) inference, which can be deployed to run on edge smart devices for low-latency diagnosis. (3) We design a data enhancement method for ECG based on deep convolutional generative adversarial network to expand ECG data volume. (4) We carried out experiments on two representative datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the deep learning model of ECG classification based on EdgeCNN. EdgeCNN shows superior to traditional cloud medical systems in terms of network Input/Output (I/O) pressure, architecture cost and system high availability. The deep learning model not only ensures high diagnostic accuracy, but also has advantages in aspect of inference time, storage, running memory and power consumption. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Wearable technology plays a key role in smart healthcare applications. Detection and analysis of the physiological data from wearable devices is an essential process in smart healthcare. Physiological data analysis is performed in fog computing to abridge the excess latency introduced by cloud computing. However, the latency for the emergency health status and overloading in fog environment becomes key challenges for smart healthcare. This paper resolves these problems by presenting a novel tri-fog health architecture for physiological parameter detection. The overall system is built upon three layers as wearable layer, intelligent fog layer, and cloud layer. In the first layer, data from the wearable of patients are subjected to fault detection at personal data assistant (PDA). To eliminate fault data, we present the rapid kernel principal component analysis (RK-PCA) algorithm. Then, the faultless data is validated, whether it is duplicate or not, by the data on-looker node in the second layer. To remove data redundancy, we propose a new fuzzy assisted objective optimization by ratio analysis (FaMOORA) algorithm. To timely predict the user’s health status, we enable the two-level health hidden Markov model (2L-2HMM) that finds the user’s health status from temporal variations in data collected from wearable devices. Finally, the user’s health status is detected in the fog layer with the assist of a hybrid machine learning algorithm, namely SpikQ-Net, based on the three major categories of attributes such as behavioral, biomedical, and environment. Upon the user’s health status, the immediate action is taken by both cloud and fog layers. To ensure lower response time and timely service, we also present an optimal health off procedure with the aid of the multi-objective spotted hyena optimization (MoSHO) algorithm. The health off method allows offloading between overloaded and underloaded fog nodes. The proposed tri-fog health model is validated by a thorough simulation performed in the iFogSim tool. It shows better achievements in latency (reduced up to 3 ms), execution time (reduced up to 1.7 ms), detection accuracy (improved up to 97%), and system stability (improved up to 96%). © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Early-stage disease risk prediction can be beneficial to improve the health of the mass and can reduce the economic burden of late treatment. Machine learning has played a pivotal role in predictive systems, which requires achieving a specific degree of accuracy for healthcare systems. Most recently researchers have found the necessity of bridging between epidemiology and machine learning classifications toward health risk prediction. This work proposes an epidemiology knowledge-driven unique model that follows the principle of association rule-based ontology to select features and classification techniques. The goal of this approach is to generalize a framework for future robust systems to predict the likelihood of diseases, which can be executed in the edge computing environment. The framework introduces epidemiological library and structured attribute set along with the library of precaution to derive the disease risk-prediction process. To investigate the adoption of the epidemiology knowledge-driven model, we considered a real dataset of early-stage likelihood prediction of diabetes and carried out a set of experiments for highlighting the significance of several epidemiological factors. The classification aspect of the framework is further compared with widely accepted approaches for machine learning based healthcare, which shows the novelty of the proposed model. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The Internet of things (IoT) is the integration of information space and physical space, becoming more and more popular in several places. In this paper, we will present QoS service composition approach based on multi-population genetic algorithm based on Fog-IoT computing, IoT-cloud architecture problems led us to use the 5-layared architecture implemented on a Fog computing system especially the transport layer. Our work was focus on this transport layer where we divided it into four sub-layers (security, storage, pre-processing monitoring), it allows us to have promising advantages. Secondly, we implemented a multi-population genetic algorithm (MPGA) based on a QoS model, we considered seven QoS dimensions, i.e. Cost, response time, reliability, reputation, location, security and availability. Experimental results show the excellent results of MPGA in terms of fitness value and execution time to handle our ambulance emergency study case. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={IoT environment is one of important upshots of IT development; it offers comfort to human daily life. We are interested in our paper in the healthcare IoT field which aims to remotely monitor the patient's health state using a set of physiological IoT sensors. In IoT systems dependability is a strong constraint because the fault occurrence can have a bad consequence on human life. The fault tolerance is one of the mechanisms that can insure a dependable function of the IoT healthcare system. To do this, we improve in this paper the centralized agent based architecture [1] by proposing more robust distributed one. That is by eliminating the weakness due to the centralization of the control. This upgrading is motivated by the fact that the current improvement of the network technologies and the occurrence of new promising paradigms like edge computing and 5G [2] require different reasoning philosophy. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The integration of medical signal processing capabilities and advanced sensors into Internet of Things (IoT) devices plays a key role in providing comfort and convenience to human lives. As the number of patients is increasing gradually, providing healthcare facilities to each patient, particularly to the patients located in remote regions, not only has become challenging but also results in several issues, such as: (i) increase in workload on paramedics, (ii) wastage of time, and (iii) accommodation of patients. Therefore, the design of smart healthcare systems has become an important area of research to overcome these above-mentioned issues. Several healthcare applications have been designed using wireless sensor networks (WSNs), cloud computing, and fog computing. Most of the e-healthcare applications are designed using the cloud computing paradigm. Cloud-based architecture introduces high latency while processing huge amounts of data, thus restricting the large-scale implementation of latency-sensitive e-healthcare applications. Fog computing architecture offers processing and storage resources near to the edge of the network, thus, designing e-healthcare applications using the fog computing paradigm is of interest to meet the low latency requirement of such applications. Patients that are minors or are in intensive care units (ICUs) are unable to self-report their pain conditions. The remote healthcare monitoring applications deploy IoT devices with bio-sensors capable of sensing surface electromyogram (sEMG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to monitor the pain condition of such patients. In this article, fog computing architecture is proposed for deploying a remote pain monitoring system. The key motivation for adopting the fog paradigm in our proposed approach is to reduce latency and network consumption. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in minimizing delay and network utilization, simulations were carried out in iFogSim and the results were compared with the cloud-based systems. The results of the simulations carried out in this research indicate that a reduction in both latency and network consumption can be achieved by adopting the proposed approach for implementing a remote pain monitoring system. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={New generation communication technologies and advanced deep learning models present a tremendous opportunity to develop fast, accurate, and seamless distributed systems in different sectors including the healthcare sector. in this article, we suggest a smart healthcare framework consisting of a pathology detection system, which is developed using deep learning. The pathology can be detected from electroencephalogram signals of a subject. in the framework, a smart EEG headset captures EEG signals and sends them to a mobile edge computing server. The server preprocesses the signals and transmits them to a cloud server. The cloud server does the main processing using deep learning and decides on whether the subject has pathology or not. Clients and stakeholders of the framework are connected via an authentication manager located in the cloud server. Experiment results on a publicly available database confirm the appropriateness of the proposed framework. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={With technological advancements, the Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming a significant method to achieve remote healthcare monitoring, where secure and efficient medical data retrieval is crucial. However, IoT devices have limited resources, so it is hard to achieve secure and efficient medical data acquisition. Edge devices in an edge cloud can offer abundant resources, whereas the Named Data Networking (NDN) can improve data retrieval efficiency. Therefore, we are motivated to combine IoT with Edge cloud (IE) and exploit NDN to achieve IE-based medical data retrieval. Inspired by the idea, we propose a secure healthcare monitoring framework integrating NDN-based IoT with edge cloud. This framework exploits the advantages of NDN to improve efficiency of medical data retrieval, and employs ciphertext and signature to support security of medical data delivery. The framework is evaluated quantitatively. According to the data results, the framework reduces the medical data retrieval latency and cost by nearly 28% and 52% compared with the existing solution, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={With the exponential growth of IoT terminals, smartphones, and wearable devices, traditional centralized cloud computing models have been unable to efficiently process data generated by edge devices. In order to meet the challenges, edge computing has been proposed. The location close to the terminal device meets the high computing volume, low latency, privacy requirements of deep learning on edge devices, bandwidth advantages, efficiency and scalability. We first introduced the background and motivation for running AI at the edge of the network, reviewed the basic concepts of deep learning, and then we provided the overall architecture of edge computing based on deep learning. We discussed three computing and inference models on terminal devices, edge servers and cross-edge devices, and describes the method to improve and optimize the edge deep learning model. Finally, we discuss the application scenarios and future opportunities of edge deep learning. © 2020 Journal of Physics: Conference Series.},

abstract={The age of virtual healthcare has created new opportunities to reconsider traditional methods for the preliminary medical examinations and clinical doctor-patient appointments. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced medical systems for strengthening online services in each medical field. Implementations of novel digital health technologies will dramatically reduce inessential hospital visits of patients for early diagnosis. Moreover, the telehealth based medical platforms will allow the medical services to be time- and cost-effective with convenient media for both patients and doctors. In this study, an internet of medical things (IoMT)-based smart healthcare monitoring platform architecture is proposed to remotely telecommunicate with optimized bandwidth efficiency and latency for a rapid decision-making process management for preliminary diagnosis in a virtual environment. The proposed edge-IoMT computing architecture framework will allow filtering and squeezing of raw medical data of the real-time video footage of the patients with functional algorithms. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has been growing exponentially in the commercial market in recent years. It is also a fact that people hold one or more computing devices at home. Many of them have been developed to operate through internet connectivity with cloud computing technologies that result in the demand for fast, robust, and secure services. In most cases, the lack of these services makes difficult the transfer of data to fulfill the devices' purposes. Under these conditions, an intermediate layer or middleware is needed to process, filter, and send data through a more efficient alternative. This paper presents the adaptive solution of a middleware architecture as an intermediate layer between smart devices and cloud computing to enhance the management of the heterogeneity of data provining from IoT devices. The proposed middleware provides easy configuration, adaptability, and bearability for different environments. Finally, this solution has been implemented in the healthcare domain, in which IoT solutions are deployed into Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) environments. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Healthcare applications are distinguished by being critical and time sensitive. Multiple healthcare applications have been implemented through Internet of Things (IoT) technology due to its capability of improving the quality and efficiency of treatments and accordingly improving the health of the patients. This paper contributes to the domain by proposing efficient IoT architecture, mobility-aware scheduling and allocation protocols for healthcare. The proposed approach supports the mobility of the patients through an adaptive Received Signal Strength (RSS) based handoff mechanism. The proposed architecture allows the dynamic distribution of healthcare tasks among computational nodes whether cloud devices or fog devices through an implementation of a mobility-aware heuristic based scheduling and allocation approach (MobMBAR). It dynamically balances the distribution of task execution according to the movements of patients and the temporal/spatial residual of their sensed data. The objective of the proposed approach is the minimization of the total schedule time through utilizing task features such as critical level and the maximum response time of the task during the ranking and reallocation phases. We validate the performance of the proposed approach by simulation and compare against other existing solutions. The simulation results have shown that missed tasks range doesn't exceed one thousandths percent, and is proven to be 88% lower than state-of-the-art solutions in terms of Makespan and 92% lower in terms of energy consumption. The paper also includes a realistic simulation for evaluating MobMBAR in an indoor hospital building in Chicago, and it has demonstrated acceptable performance. © 2020},

abstract={Domestic Pet Care has been an important domain in the healthcare industry. In the presented study, a comprehensive framework of the Smart VetCare system for the health monitoring of domestic pets has been presented. The work is focused on the remote surveillance of domestic animals’ health conditions inside the home environment using IoMT Technology. Specifically, pet health is analyzed for vulnerability in the ambient home environment and ubiquitous activities over a fog computing platform of FogBus. Furthermore, a temporal data granule is formulated and the Probability of Health Vulnerability (PoHV) is defined for determining the health severity of the animal. Additionally, the Temporal Sensitivity Measure (TSM) is defined for real-time pet healthcare analysis, which is visualized using the Self Organized Mapping (SOM) Technique. For validation purposes, the framework is deployed in the smart home environment using 12 IoMT WiSense Nodes and Health Sensor belt for monitoring a domestic dog of American Bully breed over the dynamic resource management platform of FogBus and iFogSim simulator. Based on the comparison with numerous state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed framework can register a better precision value (94.78%), accuracy value (95.38%), sensitivity value (93.71%), and f-measure value (94.41%). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Remote monitoring of older adults and detecting dangers in the state of human health have become essential elements of modern telemedicine. Falls are a frequent reason for deaths or post-traumatic complications in the elderly. Therefore, the early detection of falls can be crucial for the survival of a person or for providing necessary support. However, telemedicine data centers require scalable computing and storage resources for the growing number of monitored people. Dedicated approaches that allow for minimal data transmission of strictly interesting cases are also required. In this paper, we show a scalable architecture of a system that can monitor thousands of older adults, detect falls, and notify caregivers. Scalability tests that disclose requirements to enable large scale system operations were also performed. Moreover, we validated several Machine Learning models to evaluate their suitability in the detection process. Among the tested models, Boosted Decisions Trees resulted in the best classification performance. We also experimentally tested the detection of falls inside a Cloud-based data center and on an Edge IoT device. Results of tests on the device-to-cloud data transmission confirmed that significant reduction in the size of stored and transmitted data can be achieved while performing fall detection on the Edge. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={Real-Time health monitoring systems play a critical role in preventing heart disease by processing vital sign monitoring data. The internet of things will enhance the entire health care service-delivery and can lead to reducing the immediate risk in real-Time. Fog assisted health-care IoT system and Edge computing technology are an emerging paradigm that reducing emergency response time and enhanced the quality of experiences. In hierarchical architectures, the task placement strategy for a task or service is a challenge that requires a successful response. In this paper, we propose a quality of experiences-Aware health monitoring application according to patients' demands and evaluate to clarify the impacts of different scenarios. The appropriate task placement scenarios in this hierarchical architecture lead to a satisfying quality of experience for improving health services. These policies are evaluated in terms of health services delivery, energy consumption, cost of execution(CoE) in the cloud, and network usage by iFogSim toolkit. In this paper, we have developed a new approach to improve resource management policies to achieve satisfactory results. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The wearable devices market has been growing exponentially in the last few years and it is expected to count up to 930 million devices by the end of 2021. A common application of wearable devices is Human Activity Recognition (HAR), i.e., the ability of using the sensing capabilities of these devices to monitor and infer human activities. However, Animal Activity Recognition (AAR) has received significantly less attention, and most works on AAR are generally based on invasive specialized devices carried by or implanted on animals. Conversely, in this work we exploit the potential of portable and unobtrusive devices, namely smartwatches, for AAR and specifically for horse gaits recognition. This application finds natural use in horse riding, to improve the structure and balance of the horse work and training. We develop a framework that can be used in a fog computing system composed by a smartphone and a smartwatch for the recognition of horse gaits. The framework performs classification by means of a machine learning approach trained on ad-hoc features based on accelerometer data. The framework allows an offline and an online modes of operation. In the offline mode, the smartwatch is used to collect the accelerometer data and transfer it to the smartphone at the end of the riding session. The feature extraction and classification can be processed directly on the smartphone or offloaded to the cloud. Conversely, in the online mode, the smartwatch is responsible to collect and process the data, thus being able to provide real-time feedback to the rider. This modality also allows to reduce computation, storage, and energy burden on the smartwatch through an adaptive setting of the sampling frequency. We implement our approach on a system composed by a Fitbit Ionic smartwatch and a Samsung Galaxy S10. We use two horses to evaluate the performance, versus recently proposed AAR approaches. Results show that our framework achieves significantly higher classification accuracy. Furthermore, the online scheme enables flexible real-time feedback, at the expense of a small loss in the classification accuracy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Cloud Computing provides on-demand computing services like software, networking, storage, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet (“the cloud”). But it is facing challenges because of the explosion of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the volume, variety, veracity and velocity of the data generated by these devices. There is a need for ultra-low latency, reliable service along with security and privacy. Fog Computing is a promising solution to overcome these challenges. The originality, scope and novelty of this paper is the definition and formulation of the problem of smart neighborhoods in context of smart grids. This is achieved through an extensive literature study, firstly on Fog Computing and its foundation technologies, its applications and the literature review of Fog Computing research in various application domains. Thereafter, we introduce smart grid and community MicroGrid concepts and, their challenges to give the in depth background of the problem and hence, formalize the problem. The smart grid, which ensures reliable, secure, and cost-effective power supply to the smart neighborhoods, effectively needs Fog Computing architecture to achieve its purpose. This paper also identifies, without rigorous analysis, potential solutions to address the problem of smart neighborhoods. The challenges in the integration of Fog Computing and smart grids are also discussed. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new virus of viral pneumonia. It can outbreak in the world through person-to-person transmission. Although several medical companies provide cooperative monitoring healthcare systems, these solutions lack offering of the end-to-end management of the disease. The main objective of the proposed framework is to bridge the current gap between current technologies and healthcare systems. The wireless body area network, cloud computing, fog computing, and clinical decision support system are integrated to provide a comprehensive and complete model for disease detection and monitoring. By monitoring a person with COVID-19 in real time, physicians can guide patients with the right decisions. The proposed framework has three main layers (i.e., a patient layer, cloud layer, and hospital layer). In the patient layer, the patient is tracked through a set of wearable sensors and a mobile app. In the cloud layer, a fog network architecture is proposed to solve the issues of storage and data transmission. In the hospital layer, we propose a convolutional neural network-based deep learning model for COVID-19 detection based on patient’s X-ray scan images and transfer learning. The proposed model achieved promising results compared to the state-of-the art (i.e., accuracy of 97.95% and specificity of 98.85%). Our framework is a useful application, through which we expect significant effects on COVID-19 proliferation and considerable lowering in healthcare expenses. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={With the emerging commercial deployments of 5G Network, the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) will be able to offer more significant network capabilities such as efficient ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC), higher bandwidth for data transfer with enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and massive capacity to connect devices with massive Internet of Things (mIoT). MNOs are making huge investments to setup 5G Networks with an anticipation of growth in their revenues. However, MNOs may not see the return of investment through end user consumer base alone and may need additional revenue streams. Thus, 5G system has been designed to have advanced built-in features such as network slicing and edge computing, considering requirements from enterprise segments or vertical industries including healthcare, automotive, smart factories, mission critical communications, etc. To enable more rapid deployment of vertical services, the 5G deployments require fostering innovation at the application layer. With the growing needs of verticals industries, the operators are now focusing on enabling standards for vertical applications in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), a global standards forum for 5G. In this paper, the authors explain the Service Enabler Architecture Layer (SEAL) standard for 5G verticals and the services offered by the enabler layer. The paper also elaborates how the operators can leverage the SEAL to quickly develop and deploy vertical applications over the 5G Network. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Mobile devices are the primary communication tool in day to day life of the people. Nowadays, the enhancement of the mobile applications namely IoTApps and their exploitation in various domains like healthcare monitoring, home automation, smart farming, smart grid, and smart city are crucial. Though mobile devices are providing seamless user experience anywhere, anytime, and anyplace, their restricted resources such as limited battery capacity, constrained processor speed, inadequate storage, and memory are hindering the development of resource-intensive mobile applications and internet of things (IoT)-based mobile applications. To solve this resource constraint problem, a web service-based IoT framework is proposed by exploiting fuzzy logic methodologies. This framework augments the resources of mobile devices by offloading the resource-intensive subtasks from mobile devices to the service providing entities like Arduino, Raspberry PI controller, edge cloud, and distant cloud. Based on the recommended framework, an online Repository of Instructional Talk (RIoTalk) is successfully implemented to store and analyze the classroom lectures given by faculty in our study site. Simulation results show that there is a significant reduction in energy consumption, execution time, bandwidth utilization, and latency. The proposed research work significantly increases the resources of mobile devices by offloading the resource-intensive subtasks from the mobile device to the service provider computing entities thereby providing Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) to mobile users. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={In recent years, the proportion of elderly population in various countries has gradually increased. Increasing with age, it can entail illness. When these diseases are sudden, the elderly often die because there is no immediate treatment. Elderly care has become an important issue. According to this issue, we want to monitor the physiological data of the elderly, such as heartbeat, blood pressure, etc., through wearable devices. Once an abnormal condition is detected, the wearable device can be used to immediately request treatment from a nearby clinic or hospital. In order to improve the network quality of this service, we use the architecture of the mobile edge computing. The mobile edge computing provides features such as immediacy, low latency, proximity etc. However, the process of data transmission on the mobile edge computing has the risk of being stolen and identity authentication is also an important issue. Therefore, we propose a secure protocol based on cryptography to protect personal information with lightweight authentication. The proposed scheme aims to achieve mutual authentication, non-repudiation, integrity, user privacy, and defend against known attacks. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Health care services have become a high demand due to the rise in medical technology. As a result, related resources are being depleted. Hospitals no longer have any space to accommodate for incoming patients. Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) is a solution to this issue by creating a convenient and easy to access healthcare service. However, RPM systems are constrained by concerns on patient privacy, response time, and patient-service interaction. Patients emphasize their privacy, which requires health care services to maintain the confidentiality of their patient's information. Wearable health monitors continuously transmit data. This feature results in high volumes of data transmissions towards the servers. In the current state of wearable devices, there is a lack of giving the patient an integrated means of interacting with the healthcare centre and vice versa. In this paper, we propose an architecture that uses fog computing and Internet of Things (IoT) devices to an already existing RPM system and addresses these challenges. The introduced system enables the health care providers to verify any of their data through a local server before it is reported to the main server. Also, this design incorporates a data filter that controls the outgoing data to maintain patient privacy. Finally, the inclusion of a local server offloads the extra data processing that is required from the server for a better flow of data. Tests in latency were executed to investigate the feasibility of a scalable fog architecture against a standard cloud-device setup. The results show that the proposed fog setup yielded significantly lower latencies under an increasing number of RPM rooms compared to the cloud setup. Results further support the fog and IoT-based architecture as a potential option for a scalable RPM. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent times, we assist to an ever growing diffusion of smart medical sensors and Internet of things devices that are heavily changing the way healthcare is approached worldwide. In this context, a combination of Cloud and IoT architectures is often exploited to make smart healthcare systems capable of supporting near realtime applications when processing and performing Artificial Intelligence on the huge amount of data produced by wearable sensor networks. Anyway, the response time and the availability of cloud based systems, together with security and privacy, still represent critical issues that prevents Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices and architectures from being a reliable and effective solution to the aim. Lately, there is a growing interest towards architectures and approaches that exploit Edge and Fog computing as an answer to compensate the weaknesses of the cloud. In this paper, we propose a short review about the general use of IoT solutions in health care, starting from early health monitoring solutions from wearable sensors up to a discussion about the latest trends in fog/edge computing for smart health. © 2020},

abstract={Technological innovations have enabled the realization of a utopian world where all objects of everyday life, as well as humans, are interconnected to form an “Internet of Things (IoT).” These connected technologies and IoT solutions have led to the emergence of smart cities where all components are converted into a connected smart ecosystem. IoT has envisioned several areas of smart cities including the modern healthcare environment like real-time monitoring, patient information management, ambient-assisted living, ambient-intelligence, anomaly detection, and accelerated sensing. IoT has also brought a breakthrough in the medical domain by integrating stake holders, medical components, and hospitals to bring about holistic healthcare management. The healthcare domain is already witnessing promising IoT-based solutions ranging from embedded mobile applications to wearable devices and implantable gadgets. However, with all these exemplary benefits, there is a need to ensure the safety and privacy of the patient’s personal and medical data communicated to and from the connected devices and systems. For a smart city, it is pertinent to have an accessible, effective, and secure healthcare system for its inhabitants. This paper discusses the various elements of technology-enabled healthcare and presents a privacy-preserved and secure “Smart Medical System (SMS)” framework for the smart city ecosystem. For providing real-time analysis and responses, this paper proposes to use the concept of secured Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) for performing critical time-bound computations on the edge itself. In order to protect the medical and personal data of the patients and to make the data tamper-proof, the concept of blockchain has been used. Finally, this paper highlights the ways to capture and store the medical big data generated from IoT devices and sensors. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Fog computing improves the execution of computationally intensive services for remote client nodes as part of the data processing is performed close to the location where the results will be delivered. As opposed to other services running on smart cities, a major challenge of eHealth services on the fog is that they typically span multiple computational activities performing big data processing over sensible information that must be protected. Using the capacities of current processors can improve the servicing of remote patient nodes. This paper presents the design and validation of a framework that improves the service time of selected activities at the fog servers; precisely, of those activities requested by remote patients. It exploits the capacities of current processors to parallelize specific activities that can be run on reserved cores, and it relies on the quality of service guarantees of data distribution platforms to improve communication and response times to mobile patients. The proposed approach is validated on a prototype implementation of simulated computationally-intensive eHealth interactions, decreasing the response time by 4x when core reservation is activated. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Cloud-based IoT architectures are expecting a fast data transfer rate within a limited bandwidth. But achieving a fast data transfer rate is becoming more difficult gradually, with the massive amount of data produced by the IoT devices. The concept of edge computing gives a solution to this problem and provides fast interaction between data centers and IoT devices. With the help of edge computing, the data transfer rate has been increased drastically within a limited bandwidth. As a result, edge computing is being used in different IoT based industry including the IoT based healthcare industry. On the other hand, the distributed nature of the edge computing paradigm introduces security and privacy concerns (e.g., data theft). The IoT based healthcare solutions are getting popular among the users. Therefore, users' highly sensitive data is at high risk of theft before eventually reaching the cloud. Nowadays, these issues are being solved by introducing blockchain in different architectures. Hence, this paper is utilizing blockchain technology for providing a user-centric secure edge computing architecture for healthcare IoT devices. We are proposing to integrate blockchain to store the users' data transfer records and ensuring data security by managing the number of blockchain transactions. We are providing user-centricity by allowing users to monitor their data transactions. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Tactile edge technology that focuses on 5G or beyond 5G reveals an exciting approach to control infectious diseases such as COVID-19 internationally. The control of epidemics such as COVID-19 can be managed effectively by exploiting edge computation through the 5G wireless connectivity network. The implementation of a hierarchical edge computing system provides many advantages, such as low latency, scalability, and the protection of application and training model data, enabling COVID-19 to be evaluated by a dependable local edge server. In addition, many deep learning (DL) algorithms suffer from two crucial disadvantages: first, training requires a large COVID-19 dataset consisting of various aspects, which will pose challenges for local councils; second, to acknowledge the outcome, the findings of deep learning require ethical acceptance and clarification by the health care sector, as well as other contributors. In this article, we propose a B5G framework that utilizes the 5G network's low-latency, high-bandwidth functionality to detect COVID-19 using chest X-ray or CT scan images, and to develop a mass surveillance system to monitor social distancing, mask wearing, and body temperature. Three DL models, ResNet50, Deep tree, and Inception v3, are investigated in the proposed framework. Furthermore, blockchain technology is also used to ensure the security of healthcare data. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The future of healthcare systems is being shaped by incorporating emerged technological innovations to drive new models for patient care. By acquiring, integrating, analyzing, and exchanging medical data at different system levels, new practices can be introduced, offering a radical improvement to healthcare services. This article presents a novel smart and secure Healthcare system (ssHealth), which, leveraging advances in edge computing and blockchain technologies, permits epidemics discovering, remote monitoring, and fast emergency response. The proposed system also allows for secure medical data exchange among local healthcare entities, thus realizing the integration of multiple national and international entities and enabling the correlation of critical medical events for, for example, emerging epidemics management and control. In particular, we develop a blockchain-based architecture and enable a flexible configuration thereof, which optimize medical data sharing between different health entities and fulfil the diverse levels of Quality of Service (QoS) that ssHealth may require. Finally, we highlight the benefits of the proposed ssHealth system and possible directions for future research. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Edge computing (EC) is a promising technology capable of bridging the gap between Cloud computing services and the demands of emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Most EC-based solutions, from wearable devices to smart cities architectures, benefit from Machine Learning (ML) methods to perform various tasks, such as classification. In these cases, ML solutions need to deal efficiently with a huge amount of data, while balancing predictive performance, memory and time costs, and energy consumption. The fact that these data usually come in the form of a continuous and evolving data stream makes the scenario even more challenging. Many algorithms have been proposed to cope with data stream classification, e.g., Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) and Strict VFDT (SVFDT). Recently, Online Local Boosting (OLBoost) has also been introduced to improve predictive performance without modifying the underlying structure of the decision tree produced by these algorithms. In this work, we compared the four-way relationship among time efficiency, energy consumption, predictive performance, and memory costs, tuning the hyperparameters of VFDT and the two versions of SVFDT with and without OLBoost. Experiments over 6 benchmark datasets using an EC device revealed that VFDT and SVFDT-I were the most energy-friendly algorithms, with SVFDT-I also significantly reducing memory consumption. OLBoost, as expected, improved the predictive performance, but caused a deterioration in memory and energy consumption. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Healthcare networking and computing infrastructure is rapidly changing from closed environments to open environments that incorporate ubiquitous medical devices and novel application scenarios. For example, home-based healthcare involves the collection and analysis of data from pervasive sensors (often in real time) to guide therapy or to perform medical interventions. In this article, we address the challenges of data interoperability and regulatory compliance when designing and deploying healthcare applications in a heterogeneous home-edge-cloud environment. We propose the ChainSDI framework that leverages the blockchain technique along with abundant edge computing resources to manage secure data sharing and computing on sensitive patient data. We implement programmable ChainSDI application programming interfaces to facilitate the specification of home-based healthcare services running on a software-defined infrastructure (SDI). This article is a collaboration between computer scientists, medical researchers, healthcare IT professionals as well as healthcare providers with the goal of increasing the availability of SDI infrastructures while meeting the performance and regulatory requirements of healthcare applications. Our prototype demonstrates the feasibility of the framework and serves as a testbed for novel experimental studies in the context of emerging healthcare applications. © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Preeclampsia refers to a condition that occurs due to a sudden increase in Blood Pressure during 20 weeks of pregnancy. Preeclampsia may lead to the damage of some other organs of the body liver or kidneys or leads to the occurrence of brain stroke or seizures. It occurs in 15 to 20 women in 100 and becomes a significant reason for maternal mortality or infant loss. It is necessary to prevent the risks related to preeclampsia by monitoring the health parameters of the patient in a real-time environment. The risk assessment model, when amalgamating with IoT and other related technologies, offers intelligent solutions to monitor health parameters in a real-time environment. The present study is focusing on proposing an IoT based health assessment framework to capture the blood pressure and other health-related parameters of pregnant women continuously. The captured data is then processed and analyzed by fog nodes. These fog nodes then provide real-time suggestions to the patient for improving health conditions. Moreover, the fog nodes also send the processed data to cloud servers for further analysis by healthcare providers. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The Deep Neural Network (DNN) model is known for its high accuracy in classification tasks due to its intrinsic ability to learn the underlying patterns existing in a set of data. Hence it has gained momentum in seizure detection research, as in many other fields. However, its high performance is at the expense of an extensive training time. This is not appropriate for a real-time application such as seizure detection in which a swift reaction is required to save the life of the patient. This paper presents a novel Kriging-Bootstrapped Deep Neural Network hierarchical model for early seizure detection in which Kriging is first used to generate a well-correlated intermediate data set from the original input. The correlated data is then fed into the DNN for the final training. Experiments were carried out using electroencephalogram (EEG) data from both normal and epileptic patients. Results show that, with the same architecture and data size, the cumulative training time of the Krigging-Bootstrapped DNN is about 75% lower than that of the ordinary DNN without a compromise in performance as the proposed hybrid model shows a slightly better accuracy than the baseline DNN model. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Healthcare industry plays crucial role in the wellbeing of people across the world. With technological innovations in terms of sensing and remote patient monitoring using Internet of Things (IoT) there is greater promise from the industry to people. Wearable devices with sensing capabilities are emerged to automate the collection of vital signs of patients. It has led to sensor networks known as Wearable Body Area Networks (WBANs). The sensors associated with a human being form a WBAN and many such networks are interconnected to form a to topology that wireless WBANs to get integrated with wired networks and cloud computing through Internet and gateways. As WBANs produce large volumes of data continuously, the networks are integrated with cloud computing where on-demand, scalable and available resources are available for storage and analytics of healthcare data. With the realization of this kind of e-Health architecture, there is ongoing research on remote patient monitoring where data collected by sensors ultimately reach cloud. In such WBANs topology there is need for secure and efficient routing towards Quality of Service (QoS) and bandwidth optimization. In the existing systems, there were issues like delay and security issues. In this paper we integrate the WBANs topology with fog computing and cloud computing for effectiveness in QoS and bandwidth optimization. Two algorithms are proposed to achieve dynamic channel assignment and integration with fog gateway for leveraging QoS in routing. The proposed model along with its algorithms is simulated using NS-2 under different conditions such as mobility, possible attacks, fog density and interference. The experimental results revealed that the proposed solution achieves significant improvements in resiliency and efficiency of WBANs based healthcare system. © 2020 SERSC.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has gain the importance with the growing applications in the fields of ubiquitous and context-aware computing. In IoT, anything can be a portion of it, whether it is unintelligent objects or sensor nodes; thus extremely different kinds of services can be developed. In this regard, data storage, resource management, service creation and discovery, and resource and power management would facilitate advanced mechanism and much better infrastructure. Cloud computing and fog computing play an important role when the quantity of data and information IoT are critical. Thus, it would not be potential for standalone strength forced IoT to handle. Cloud of things is an integration of IoT with cloud computing or fog computing which can aid to realize the objectives of evolving IoT and future Internet. Fog computing is an expansion to the notion of cloud computing to the network brim, making it suitable for IoT and other implementations that need real-time and fundamental interactions. Regardless of many virtually and services unlimited resources presented by cloud-like intelligent building monitoring and others, it yet countenances various difficulties when interfering many smart things in human's life. Mobility, response time, and location consciousness are the most prominent problems. Fog and mobile edge computing have been established, to get rid of these difficulties of cloud computing. In this article, we suggest a novel framework based on computer propped diagnosis and IoT to detect and observe type-2 diabetes patients.

abstract={Thousands of high-end physical servers are used to fulfill the huge resource demand of diverse applications or services, ranging from healthcare data analytic services to gaming services. The network latency, as one of the major limitations of cloud computing, becomes the primary reason for introducing fog computing by pushing the computing environment towards the edge of the network. The ability to offer computing environments in close proximity to the user's device improves the delivery of high-quality services. The majority of the research is devoted to providing the high quality of services using either fog or cloud environment. In this paper, a novel deep reinforcement learning-based service dispersal approach for fog and cloud computing (DRLSD-FC) is adopted for offering the service using both environments simultaneously. The request to avail services is sliced and dispersed between the nearby fog and cloud environments. By taking advantage of cloud resources, the proposed approach minimizes the workload on the fog environment without compromising the service quality. The proposed approach is implemented using the Keras framework. Implementation results show that DRLSD-FC can outperform over other related approaches. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The possibility of continuous monitoring of health conditions represents a crucial aspect for the improvement of living conditions, the prevention of potential pathologies and prompt response in critical situations. In particular, in intensive care or emergency situations, the evaluation of illness degree of a clinical risk level can be considered a predictive task in situations where streams of vital signs data are gathered by medical devices and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) sensors. In this framework, Early Warning Score (EWS) systems generating an aggregate score based on the measurement of a set of vital signs, such as National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) and Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), may provide a helpful decision support for the estimation of health state and triggers for critical care intervention. In the present work, we address a preliminary analysis in order to investigate the most suitable Machine Learning (ML) technique for the prediction of clinical risk classes of a continuously monitored patient in a particular condition where a limited number of vital parameters is available. This analysis is then intended to be preparatory for the final goal of designing an edge device connected to one or more wearable medical devices via IoMT, which adaptively exploits the best ML model to predict a reliable EWS. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The emergence of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) has revolutionized our lives by enabling a 360° artificial sensory stimulation across diverse domains, including, but not limited to, sports, media, healthcare, and gaming. Unlike the conventional planar video processing, where memory access is the main bottleneck, in 360° VR videos the compute is the primary bottleneck and contributes to more than 50% energy consumption in battery-operated VR headsets. Thus, improving the computational efficiency of the video processing pipeline in a VR is critical. While prior efforts have attempted to address this problem through acceleration using a GPU or FPGA, none of them has analyzed the 360° VR pipeline to examine if there is any scope to optimize the computation with known techniques such as memoization. Thus, in this paper, we analyze the VR computation pipeline and observe that there is significant scope to skip computations by leveraging the temporal and spatial locality in head orientation and eye correlations, respectively, resulting in computation reduction and energy efficiency. The proposed Déjà View design takes advantage of temporal reuse by memoizing head orientation and spatial reuse by establishing a relationship between left and right eye projection, and can be implemented either on a GPU or an FPGA. We propose both software modifications for existing compute pipeline and microarchitectural additions for further enhancement. We evaluate our design by implementing the software enhancements on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 GPU board and our microarchitectural additions on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA model using five video workloads. Experimental results show that Déjà View can provide 34% computation reduction and 17% energy saving, compared to the state-of-the-art design. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={As an essential part of the telemedicine system, teleradiology not only realizes mutual recognition of image diagnosis among medical institutions, but also ensures the quality of medical image diagnosis. In this paper, an edge computing (EC) driven 5G teleradiology framework is proposed to segment glioma accurately. In our framework, through the high-speed transmission and sharing mechanism of medical image data under 5G condition, the high-definition magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images data of glioma patients are delivered to the edge server for data augmentation and training. Three typical data augmentation methods, i.e., traditional geometric transformation, DCGAN, and CycleGAN, are used to study the impact of the proportions of synthetic images generated by the above data augmentation methods to original MRI images on the performance of glioma segmentation. It is observed that training with different proportions leads to different segmentation results. Based on this observation, an efficient data augmentation strategy is established, which exploits the optimal proportions of synthetic and original data to yield the best glioma segmentation results in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Dice score. Experiments on the BraTS dataset show that the proposed data augmentation strategy improves the average Dice score of Dense U-net compared to the conventional data augmentation method. With the aid of our EC driven 5G teleradiology framework, accurate glioma segmentation results can be acquired rapidly at the terminal equipment to facilitate the online diagnosis. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={With the widespread application of mobile edge computing (MEC), MEC is serving as a bridge to narrow the gaps between medical staff and patients. Relatedly, MEC is also moving toward supervising individual health in an automatic and intelligent manner. One of the main MEC technologies in healthcare monitoring systems is human activity recognition (HAR). Built-in multifunctional sensors make smartphones a ubiquitous platform for acquiring and analyzing data, thus making it possible for smartphones to perform HAR. The task of recognizing human activity using a smartphone’s built-in accelerometer has been well resolved, but in practice, with the multimodal and high-dimensional sensor data, these traditional methods fail to identify complicated and real-time human activities. This paper designs a smartphone inertial accelerometer-based architecture for HAR. When the participants perform typical daily activities, the smartphone collects the sensory data sequence, extracts the high-efficiency features from the original data, and then obtains the user’s physical behavior data through multiple three-axis accelerometers. The data are preprocessed by denoising, normalization and segmentation to extract valuable feature vectors. In addition, a real-time human activity classification method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed, which uses a CNN for local feature extraction. Finally, CNN, LSTM, BLSTM, MLP and SVM models are utilized on the UCI and Pamap2 datasets. We explore how to train deep learning methods and demonstrate how the proposed method outperforms the others on two large public datasets: UCI and Pamap2. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is quickly expanding among consumers, companies, organizations, and governments. The spreading of smart systems where the IoT devices play a main role in accumulate, store, and share user data is discernibly increased. Moreover, the increasing integration of big data, cloud computing, and IoT in the future systems and organizations will increase the demands for computational resources, and the ability for the applications to interact and communicate with each other, within and across organizational boundaries. As cloud and mobile computing play a critical role in future systems. With all this advancement, the security challenges are generated, and it is considered as a developing concern. In this Work, we will discuss different security models provided for Cloud-Enabled IoT architectures security issues. Then, we will propose a security model using Amazon Web Service (AWS) cloud provider platform with Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) on different levels: IoT, Edge, and the cloud. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in the 21st century has led to exciting achievements. IoT smart medical devices along with wearables are generating and communicating high volume and high-velocity of heterogeneous data. Consequently, services provided by traditional methods such as cloud computing to manage these data become insufficient. Fog computing is seen as being the most effective solution for IoT-based healthcare. The stringy demand of this model was principally driven by a growing need for real-time analysis and low latency. It is apparently envisioned that the medicine field expects to draw enormous interest in combining IoT and fog computing. This in turn, improved the patient treatment, staff satisfaction, and operational efficiency and showed positive influence on all aspects of healthcare. This paper has reviewed fog computing in the context of medical IoT while comparing it with cloud computing and has attempted to present the three-layer architecture of fog-based healthcare system containing: edge, fog and cloud. It has also highlighted challenges facing IoT-driven healthcare in an ever-changing world. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={The growth of ubiquitous healthcare systems, particularly for general and residential healthcare, is increasing dramatically. One of the most significant components of such systems is the gateway, which acts as a middleware between Internet of Things (IoT) devices and cloud application services. Here, we propose an IoT edge gateway framework based on docker container technology as the legacy virtualization technology to empower microservice architectures for aiding multiple-device real-time monitoring in locations such as nursing homes and residential care centers. The framework is used to identify IoT devices and the gateway itself in home networks for restricting access only to authorized users and non-manipulated devices. We propose the use of state-of-the-art hardware-based security supporting the mutual authentication process with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm as well as integrity protection to validate the device, gateway, and cloud platform integrity to identify manipulation and detect unauthorized changes by signing these data. This approach can prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. As a result, we can implement each service located in this proposed IoT edge gateway framework to enhance capabilities in edge analytics by adding hardened security with the average latency time at 2.373 ms. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={With the rising popularity of wearable devices and sensors, shielding Body Area Networks (BANs) from eavesdroppers has become an urgent problem to solve. Since the conventional key distribution systems are too onerous for resource-constrained wearable sensors, researchers are pursuing a new light-weight key generation approach that enables two wearable devices attached at different locations of the user body to generate an identical key simultaneously simply from their independent observations of user gait. A key challenge for such gait-based key generation lies in matching the bits of the keys generated by independent devices despite the noisy sensor measurements, especially when the devices are located far apart on the body affected by different sources of noise. To address the challenge, we propose a novel machine learning framework, called Auto-Key, that uses an autoencoder to help one device predict the gait observations at another distant device attached to the same body and generate the key using the predicted sensor data. We prototype the proposed method and evaluate it using a public acceleration dataset collected from 15 real subjects wearing accelerometers attached to seven different locations of the body. Our results show that, on average, Auto-Key increases the matching rate of independently generated bits from two sensors attached at two different locations by 16.5%, which speeds up the successful generation of fully-matching symmetric keys at independent wearable sensors by a factor of 1.9. In the proposed framework, a subject-specific model can be trained with 50% fewer data and 88% less time by retraining a pre-trained general model when compared to training a new model from scratch. The reduced training complexity makes Auto-Key more practical for edge computing, which provides better privacy protection to biometric and behavioral data compared to cloud-based training. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Mobile edge computing (MEC) based solutions are essential and of great significance for a wide range of promising 5G wireless big data services such as remote healthcare systems and AR/VR games. Present research in this area focuses on the downlink resource allocation scenarios from MEC servers to user equipments (UEs). This paper considers a multi-user MEC-enabled wireless communication system, where UEs suffer limited communication and computation resources. To achieve higher energy efficiency and the better experience for UEs, we aim to maximize the number of offloaded tasks for all UEs in uplink communication while maintaining the computation resources of MEC at an acceptable level. The formulated problem is an NP-hard mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem and it is a challenge to solve it efficiently. As such, an efficient low-complexity heuristic algorithm is proposed, which provides a near-optimal solution with a low time cost. The results show that the proposed scheme achieves the higher number of successful offloaded tasks than the existing centralized resource allocation algorithm (CRAA) and centralized decision and resource allocation algorithm that UEs with the largest saved energy consumption accepted first (CAR-E) under different scenarios. Moreover, the relationship between the optimal transmission power and the computation resource of MEC is investigated. The results obtained in this paper can be extended to design a novel framework of communication, computation and smart coded caching MEC networks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Cloud computing provides resources over the Internet and allows a plethora of applications to be deployed to provide services for different industries. The major bottleneck being faced currently in these cloud frameworks is their limited scalability and hence inability to cater to the requirements of centralized Internet of Things (IoT) based compute environments. The main reason for this is that latency-sensitive applications like health monitoring and surveillance systems now require computation over large amounts of data (Big Data) transferred to centralized database and from database to cloud data centers which leads to drop in performance of such systems. The new paradigms of fog and edge computing provide innovative solutions by bringing resources closer to the user and provide low latency and energy efficient solutions for data processing compared to cloud domains. Still, the current fog models have many limitations and focus from a limited perspective on either accuracy of results or reduced response time but not both. We proposed a novel framework called HealthFog for integrating ensemble deep learning in Edge computing devices and deployed it for a real-life application of automatic Heart Disease analysis. HealthFog delivers healthcare as a fog service using IoT devices and efficiently manages the data of heart patients, which comes as user requests. Fog-enabled cloud framework, FogBus is used to deploy and test the performance of the proposed model in terms of power consumption, network bandwidth, latency, jitter, accuracy and execution time. HealthFog is configurable to various operation modes which provide the best Quality of Service or prediction accuracy, as required, in diverse fog computation scenarios and for different user requirements. We released HealthFog as an open source software. The implementation code with experiment scripts and results can be found at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/Cloudslab/HealthFog © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Mixed Reality (MR) technologies provide users with an environment that incorporates virtual objects and metadata into their physical surroundings. This opens up exciting new possibilities for applications in various domains including: education, training, healthcare, and Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). Recognizing physical objects in the environment provides contextual clues that can improve user task performance and influence effective cognitive load for complex tasks. However, this facet of MR is still relatively nascent because of hardware limitations. Presently, MR headsets can only detect physical surfaces; they can not distinguish between physical artifacts that a user might need in their work environment. Machine Learning (ML) based object recognition solutions can help overcome this limitation. However, current commercially available MR devices have insufficient computational capabilities and are unable to support the state-of-the-art ML based object recognition solutions. To address these challenges, we describe a novel approach and the corresponding framework by introducing a hardware level separation between the two tasks of object recognition and rendering virtual components. Our approach leverages ML based object recognition, MR, and a portable IoT edge computing platform to support contextual awareness. We describe the implementation of this approach and provide a case study. The prototype implementation uses an edge device to process and recognize objects to get information about the user's physical environment and provides the user with situational awareness through the MR device. Our case study uses a Christmas tree decoration activity to demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to support assembly-type tasks. The case study establishes the applicability of the proposed approach to a variety of problem domains. Object recognition and context aware capabilities, combined with virtual indicators and instructions, provide a solution that increases usability, helps reduce human error, and improves the overall task performance. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={To provide customized healthcare services in edge computing environment, it is necessary to process perspectives related to delivering context information such as procedures of data collection and analysis in various data formats. It is required to have a fat-client concept that performs, data preprocessing and converting data formats where generated data sets have different structure. Furthermore, the fat-client concept has advantages of covering data acquisitions and job allocations in edge computing environment. Once data sets are collected, then users can have healthcare reports, analyzed in a different level. When dealing with procedures of analysis, their models are necessary because data sets have different formats and ranges, moreover models will be required for user customizing it by adjustment the data sets being collected. This paper proposes a method for managing fat-client to provide customized healthcare services in edge computing environment. The proposed method, provides a fat-client profile for managing each fat-client user. The fat-client profile includes information such as sequences of data sources and analysis methods. In the experiment, the fat-client management is demonstrated through data collection and monitoring of instances created by the Fat-Client profile. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={With the rapid increase in urbanisation, the concept of smart cities has attracted considerable attention. By leveraging emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence and cloud computing, smart cities have the potential to improve various indicators of residents’ quality of life. However, threats to data integrity may affect the delivery of such benefits, especially in the IoT environment where most devices are inherently dynamic and have limited resources. Prior work has focused on ensuring integrity of data in a piecemeal manner and covering only some parts of the smart city ecosystem. In this paper, we address integrity of data from an end-to-end perspective, i.e., from the data source to the data consumer. We propose a holistic framework for ensuring integrity of data in smart cities that covers the entire data lifecycle. Our framework is founded on three fundamental concepts, namely, secret sharing, fog computing and blockchain. We provide a detailed description of various components of the framework and also utilize smart healthcare as use case. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Ulcerative Colitis is a fairly common, chronic or long-term disease that causes inflammation of the large intestine. It can be debilitating and can sometimes lead to life threatening complications. Therefore, its diagnosis in nascent stages is important. Healthcare services based on Fog-Cloud assisted Cyber-Physical Systems are emerging as a proactive and efficacious solution to provide remote monitoring of individuals for early detection and consequent management of several diseases. This paper presents a novel IoT-Fog-Cloud assisted Cyber Physical System for diagnosis and stage classification of Ulcerative Colitis using Naïve Bayes classifier and Deep Neural Network respectively. A vital point of this paper is real-time alert generation from Fog Layer in case the user need emergency treatment if he/she is already diagnosed with UC. Finally, analysis results and compiled medical information of each user is stored on cloud. Implementation results of the proposed framework proves its efficiency in diagnosis and subsequent stage classification of Ulcerative Colitis with real-time classification mechanism at fog layer. Furthermore, alert generation improves the efficacy of the proposed system. © 2019},

abstract={Computer assisted automatic smart pattern analysis of cancer affected pixel structure takes critical role in pre-interventional decision making for oral cancer treatment. Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare systems is now emerging solution for modern e-healthcare system to provide high quality medical care. In this research work, we proposed a novel method which utilizes a modified vesselness measurement and a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to identify the oral cancer region structure in IoT based smart healthcare system. The robust vesselness filtering scheme handles noise while reserving small structures, while the CNN framework considerably improves classification accuracy by deblurring focused region of interest (ROI) through integrating with multi-dimensional information from feature vector selection step. The marked feature vector points are extracted from each connected component in the region and used as input for training the CNN. During classification, each connected part is individually analysed using the trained DCNN by considering the feature vector values that belong to its region. For a training of 1500 image dataset, an accuracy of 96.8% and sensitivity of 92% is obtained. Hence, the results of this work validate that the proposed algorithm is effective and accurate in terms of classification of oral cancer region in accurate decision making. The developed system can be used in IoT based diagnosis in health care systems, where accuracy and real time diagnosis are essential. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Wireless body area network includes some tiny wearable sensors for monitoring the physiological data of user, which has been a promising method of promoting the quality and efficiency greatly in healthcare. The collected physical signs are aggregated into the medical documents and uploaded to cloud server for utilizing by the remote user. As these files are highly sensitive privacy data, there is a vital challenge that constructs a secure and efficient communication architecture in this application scenario. Based on this standpoint, we present a lightweight verifiability ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption protocol with outsourced decryption in this article. Specifically, our construction enjoys the following six features: (1) Although the outsourced decryption enables to save the computation overhead of the data user sharply in an attribute-based encryption scheme, the ciphertext is out of control and the correctness cannot be guaranteed by the data owner. The proposal provides the verifiability of ciphertext that ensures the user to check the correctness efficiently. (2) The size of the ciphertext is constant that is not increased with the complexity of attribute and access structure. (3) For Internet of Things devices, it introduces the fog computing into our protocol for the purpose of low latency and relation interactions, which has virtually saved the bandwidth. (4) With the help of blockchain technique, we encapsulate the hash value of public parameter, original and transformed ciphertext and transformed key into a block, so that the tamper-resistance is facilitated against an adversary from inside and outside the system. (5) In the standard model, we prove that it is selectively chosen-plaintext attack-secure and verifiable provided that the computational bilinear Diffie–Hellman assumption holds. (6) It implements this protocol and shows the result of performance measurement, which indicates a significant reduction on communication and computation costs burden on every entity in wireless body area network. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm aimed at connecting everyday objects to the internet. IoT applications include smart cities, healthcare, agriculture, as well as the industry and manufacturing. The ability to monitor and control the physical world using information technology creates many opportunities. However, it also comes with some costs. The exponential growth of connected devices, the heterogeneity of IoT use cases, and the diversity of the network technologies yield a concern regarding IoT sustainability. With this work, we aim to contribute to this concern. In doing so, we introduce a novel representation model that is destined for (i) monitoring the IoT environment at runtime, (ii) expressing the overall quality of the system, and (iii) helping to utilize the available resources efficiently. We also define a feature set that describes the best the expectations of decentralized IoT platforms. Furthermore, we describe a quality-enabled decentralized IoT architecture too that incorporates the specified feature set as well as our representation model. Such solutions are necessary to improve and maintain IoT of the future and all its application domains, including the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). With the presented research, we aim to encourage the efficient utilization of resources and simplify the production of next-generation IoT solutions. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Internet is a large network of networks that spans the entire globe. Internet is playing indispensable role in our daily lives. The physical things are connected to internet with the help of digital identity. With recent advancement of information and communication technologies IoT became vital part of human life. However, IoT is not having standardized architecture. Nowadays IoT is integrated with fog computing which extends platform of cloud computing by providing computing resources on edges of computer network. Fog computing is motivated by IOT and It is decentralized solution for IoT. In addition, Fog computing has supported features like geographic distribution, low latency, location awareness, operate on premise, installed on heterogeneous hardware. IoT with cloud computing does not have such features. Therefore, in this paper, at first we discuss about the distributed fog computing architecture. Subsequently, we address the problem of authentication and design a new authentication framework for fog enabled IOT environment. It is stated that the proposed authentication framework will be useful in many IoT applications such as healthcare system, transportation system, smart cities, home energy management etc. © 2020, Kohat University of Science and Technology.},

abstract={The aim of the Internet of things (IoT) is to bring every object (wearable sensors, healthcare sensors, cameras, home appliances, smart phones, etc.) online. These different objects generate huge data which consequently lead to the need of requirements of efficient storage and processing. Cloud computing is an emerging technology to overcome this problem. However, there are some applications (healthcare) which need to process data in real time to improve its performance and require low latency and delay. Fog computing is one of the promising solutions which facilitate healthcare domain in terms of reducing the delay multihop data communication, distributing resource demands, and promoting service flexibility. In this study, a fog-based IoT healthcare framework is proposed in order to minimize the energy consumption of the fog nodes. Experimental results reveal that the performance of the proposed framework is efficient in terms of network delay and energy usage. Furthermore, the authors discussed and suggested important services of big data infrastructure which need to be present in fog devices for the analytics of healthcare big data. © 2020 Chong Feng et al.},

abstract={In recent years, healthcare IoT have been helpful in mitigating pressures of hospital and medical resources caused by aging population to a large extent. As a safety-critical system, the rapid response from the health care system is extremely important. To fulfill the low latency requirement, fog computing is a competitive solution by deploying healthcare IoT devices on the edge of clouds. However, these fog devices generate huge amount of sensor data. Designing a specific framework for fog devices to ensure reliable data transmission and rapid data processing becomes a topic of utmost significance. In this paper, a Reduced Variable Neighborhood Search (RVNS)-based sEnsor Data Processing Framework (REDPF) is proposed to enhance reliability of data transmission and processing speed. Functionalities of REDPF include fault-tolerant data transmission, self-adaptive filtering and data-load-reduction processing. Specifically, a reliable transmission mechanism, managed by a self-adaptive filter, will recollect lost or inaccurate data automatically. Then, a new scheme is designed to evaluate the health status of the elderly people. Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposed scheme improves network reliability, and provides a faster processing speed. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of resource-constrained smart devices capable to sense and process data. It connects a huge number of smart sensing devices, i.e., things, and heterogeneous networks. The IoT is incorporated into different applications, such as smart health, smart home, smart grid, etc. The concept of smart healthcare has emerged in different countries, where pilot projects of healthcare facilities are analyzed. In IoT-enabled healthcare systems, the security of IoT devices and associated data is very important, whereas Edge computing is a promising architecture that solves their computational and processing problems. Edge computing is economical and has the potential to provide low latency data services by improving the communication and computation speed of IoT devices in a healthcare system. In Edge-based IoT-enabled healthcare systems, load balancing, network optimization, and efficient resource utilization are accurately performed using artificial intelligence (AI), i.e., intelligent software-defined network (SDN) controller. SDN-based Edge computing is helpful in the efficient utilization of limited resources of IoT devices. However, these low powered devices and associated data (private sensitive data of patients) are prone to various security threats. Therefore, in this paper, we design a secure framework for SDN-based Edge computing in IoT-enabled healthcare system. In the proposed framework, the IoT devices are authenticated by the Edge servers using a lightweight authentication scheme. After authentication, these devices collect data from the patients and send them to the Edge servers for storage, processing, and analyses. The Edge servers are connected with an SDN controller, which performs load balancing, network optimization, and efficient resource utilization in the healthcare system. The proposed framework is evaluated using computer-based simulations. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides better solutions for IoT-enabled healthcare systems. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, researchers around the world in medical institutions and pharmaceutical companies are demanding a wider access to healthcare data for secondary use in order to provide enhanced and personalized medical services. For this purpose, healthcare information exchange between health authorities can be leveraged as a fundamental concept to meet these demands and enable the discovery of new insights and cures. However, health data are highly sensitive and private information that requires strong authentication and authorization procedures to manage the access to them. In this regard, the cloud paradigm has been used in these e-healthcare solutions, but they remain inefficient due to their inability to adapt to the expanding volume of data generated from body sensors and their vulnerability against cyberattacks. Hence, collaborative and distributed data governance supported by edge computing and blockchain promises enormous potentials in improving the performance and security of the whole system. In this paper, we present a secure and efficient data management framework, named 'EdgeMediChain', for sharing health data. The proposed architecture leverages both edge computing and blockchain to facilitate and provide the necessary requirements for a healthcare ecosystem in terms of scalability, security, as well as privacy. The Ethereum-based testbed evaluations show the effectiveness of EdgeMediChain in terms of execution time with a reduction of nearly 84.75% for 2000 concurrent transactions, higher throughput compared to a traditional blockchain, and scalable ledger storage with a linear growth rate. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Smart architecture is the concept to manage the facilities via internet utilization in a proper manner. There are various technologies used in smart architecture such as cloud computing, internet of things, green computing, automation and fog computing. Smart medical system (SMS) is one of the application used in architecture, which is based on communication networking along with sensor devices. In SMS, a doctor provides online treatment to patients with the help of cloud-based applications such as mobile device, wireless body area network, etc. Security and privacy are the major concern of cloud-based applications in SMS. To maintain, security and privacy, we aim to design an elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) based secure and efficient authentication framework for cloud-assisted SMS. There are six phases in the proposed protocol such as: patient registration phase, healthcare center upload phase, patient data upload phase, treatment phase, checkup phase and emergency phase. In CSEF, there are four entities like healthecare center, patient, cloud and doctor. In CSEF, mutual authentication establishes between healthcare center and cloud, patient and cloud, doctor and cloud, and patient and healthcare center by the using ECC and hash function. The CSEF is secure against security attacks, and satisfies many security attributes such as man-in-the-middle attack, impersonation attack, data non-repudiation, doctor anonymity, replay attack, known-key security property, message authentication, patient anonymity, data confidentiality, stolen-verifier attack, parallel session attack and session key security. Further, the CSEF is efficient in terms of computation and communication compared to others related frameworks. As a result, CSEF can be utilized in cloud-based SMS. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In the past decade, the evolution of computing has moved from distributed, parallel, grid, cloud, and now to fog computing. The massive amount of data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices is growing up exponentially. The flood of information (generated by those IoT/Internet-connected devices) becomes troublesome for data processing and analytical prediction functionality using cloud computation. Several problems have been investigated with cloud computing with respect to latency, limited bandwidth, low Internet connectivity, etc. Here, solution to such problems can be solved by introducing fog computing with powerful functionality of cloud framework, i.e., based on the deployment of fog nodes called microclouds at nearest edge of data sources. Fog computing for big data/IoT data analytics is in evolving phase and requires extensive research to produce more knowledge and smart decisions. This article discusses several basic facts related to fog commuting, challenges in fog computing and opportunities in the near future, in the context of fog big IoT data analytics. In addition, this work also emphasizes the key characteristics in some proposed research works, those make the fog computing as a suitable (useful) platform for new proliferating IoT devices, services, and applications. Most significant fog applications (e.g. healthcare monitoring, smart cities, connected vehicles, and smart grid, etc.) will be discussed here to create a well-organized green and quantum computing paradigm to support the next generation of IoT applications. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Nowadays, many people are facing the problem of arthritis. Regular monitoring and consultation of joint health from a specialist can help patients with this chronicle disease. The ratio of orthopedic doctors to patients with arthritis is low, worldwide. Use of smart devices can support the healthcare industry a lot. Motivated by these facts, here we propose an architecture to track the hand movements of the patient. For regular monitoring of patients with arthritis, fog and cloud gateways for real-time response generation are used. Thread protocol and Bayesian network classifier have been included in the proposed architecture to achieve reliable communication and anomaly detection, respectively. A dataset of 431 patients with arthritis is taken in real time and simulated on OMNet++ simulator. Observations show that the packet delivery ratio is improved by 15-20%, the response time is reduced by 20-30%, and the packet delivery rate is improved by 25-35%, in comparison to not using the fog and thread protocol. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The rapid development of personal health records (PHR) systems enables an individual to collect, create, store and share his PHR to authorized entities. Health care systems within the smart city environment require a patient to share his PRH data with a multitude of institutions' repositories located in the cloud. The cloud computing paradigm cannot meet such a massive transformative healthcare systems due to drawbacks including network latency, scalability and bandwidth. Fog computing relieves the load of conventional cloud computing by availing intermediate fog nodes between the end users and the remote servers. Assuming a massive demand of PHR data within a ubiquitous smart city, we propose a secure and fog assisted framework for PHR systems to address security, access control and privacy concerns. Built under a fog-based architecture, the proposed framework makes use of efficient key exchange protocol coupled with ciphertext attribute based encryption (CP-ABE) to guarantee confidentiality and fine-grained access control within the system respectively. We also make use of digital signature combined with CP-ABE to ensure the system authentication and users privacy. We provide the analysis of the proposed framework in terms of security and performance. © 2021 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) promotes the assistance of a patient at home according to her/his Clinical Pathway, i.e., a set of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures related to the treatment of that specific patient. AAL is increasingly gaining momentum thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT). Edge-Computing would boost the AAL success, since this kind of architecture promotes a sort of distributed cloud computing at the edges of the IoT network, thus reducing latency and improving reliability. This poster paper focuses on the implementation, in a AAL system based on such an IoT-Edge-Computing coupled architecture, of an anomaly detection module able to detect deviations from the patient’s Clinical Pathway (CP) and avoid processing of inconsistent or fake data, which could result in a serious life-threatening for a patient. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Recent advances in mobile technologies and cloud computing services have inspired the development of cloud-based real-time health monitoring systems. However, the transfer of health-related data to the cloud contributes to the burden on the networking infrastructures, leading to high latency and increased power consumption. Fog computing is introduced to relieve this burden by bringing services to the users’ proximity. This study proposes a new fog computing architecture for health monitoring applications based on a Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) access network. An Energy-Efficient Fog Computing (EEFC) model is developed using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to optimize the number and location of fog devices at the network edge to process and analyze the health data for energy-efficient fog computing. The performance of the EEFC model at low data rates and high data rates health applications is studied. The outcome of the study reveals that a total energy saving of 36% and 52% are attained via processing and analysis the health data at the fog in comparison to conventional processing and analysis at the central cloud for low data rate application and high data rate application, respectively. We also developed a real-time heuristic; Energy Optimized Fog Computing (EOFC) heuristic, with energy consumption performance approaching the EEFC model. Furthermore, we examined the energy efficiency improvements under different scenarios of devices idle power consumption and traffic volume. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

abstract={Mosquitoes play a major role in spreading virus to human. One of the major virus is dengue, and it will cause an impact in the normal health condition. It will lead to some side effects in the human body. The prevention steps that are followed by some countries are not sufficient to control the disease. The remote monitoring as well as the detection and prevention with the help of fog and cloud environment will be an effective solution. The proposed framework will act as an effective method for detecting the people affected by dengue at earlier stage, that will help the medical team to provide treatment. The framework presented in this paper will classify the people depends upon the symptoms, alert is send to the people immediately through the mobile. The framework will help the doctors to find the impact of the disease by analysing the outcome and to act effectively within a limited period of time. © 2019, IUPESM and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) and the evolution in communication technologies have an important promising trend in healthcare domain. By exploring connected medical devices, some healthcare services are moved from the hospital to the home environment and the control of patients is continuous in a comfortable home environment. Various solutions based on Cloud services and IoT technologies are explored to collect and analyze the patient data. However, availability limitation can arise when transferring huge amounts of patient data from IoT devices onto cloud. To support these challenges, a third layer between the cloud and devices which is known as Edge layer is proposed. In this paper, we present the benefits of using edge computing for home-based healthcare and we propose an edge-based architecture that enables the medical staff to change the edge layer configuration using a cloud service. We focus specially on the integration of cloud services and edge services to ensure an effective control and monitoring of the patient data. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Along with the rapid development of modern high-tech and the change of people's awareness of healthy life, the demand for personal healthcare services is gradually increasing. The rapid progress of information and communication technol-ogy and medical and bio technology not only improves personal healthcare services, but also brings the fact that the human being has entered the era of longevity. At present, there are many researches focused on various wearable sensing devices and implant devices and Internet of Things in order to capture personal daily life health information more conveniently and effectively, and significant results have been obtained, such as fog computing. To provide personal healthcare services, the fog and cloud computing is an effective solution for sharing health information. The health big data analysis model can provide personal health situation reports on a daily basis, and the gene sequencing can provide hereditary disease prediction. However, the injury mortality and emergency diseases since long ago caused death and great pain for the family. And there are no effective rescue methods to save precious lives and no methods to predict the disease morbidity likelihood. The purpose of this research is to capture personal daily health information based on sensors and monitoring emergency situations with the help of fog computing and mobile applications, and disease prediction based on cloud computing and big data analysis. Through the comparison of test results it was proved that the proposed emergency monitoring based on fog and cloud computing and the diseases predic-tion model based on big data analysis not only gain more of the rescue time than the traditional emergency treatment method, but they also accumulate lots of difierent personal healthcare related experience. The Taian 960 hospital of PLA and the Yanbian Hospital as IM testbed were joined to provide emergency monitoring tests, and to ensure the CVD and CVA morbidity likelihood medical big data analysis, the people around Taian city participated in personal health tests. Through the project, the five network layers architecture and integrated MAPE-K Model based EMDPS platform not only made the cooperation between hospitals feasible to deal with emergency situations, but also the Internet medicine for the disease prediction was built. © 2020 Slovak Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Critical infrastructures are bringing security, and safety for people in terms of healthcare, water, electricity, industry, transportation, etc. The huge amount of data produced by CIs need to be aggregated, filtered, and stored. Cloud computing was merged into the CIs for utilizing cloud data centers as a pay-as-you-go online computing system for outsourcing services for data storage, filtering and aggregating. On the other hand, CIs need real-time processing for providing sophisticated services to people. Consequently, fog computing is merged into CIs aimed at providing services closer to the users, turning into a smooth real-time decision making and processing. When considering both, that is fog and cloud (for example, deploying the recently coined hierarchical fog-to-cloud F2C concept), new enriched features may be applied to the CIs. Security in CIs is one of the most essential challenges since any failure or attack can turn into a national wise disaster. Moreover, CIs also need to support quality of service (QoS) guarantees for users. Thus, bringing balanced QoS vs security is one of the main challenges for any CI infrastructure. In this paper, we illustrate the benefits of deploying an F2C system in CIs, particularly identifying specific F2C security requirements to be applied to CIs. Finally, we also introduce a decoupled security architecture specifically tailored to CIs that can bring security with reasonable QoS in terms of authentication and key distribution time delay. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Recently, wearable technologies have evolved in the most unexpected field like a military force outside of healthcare, fitness, lifestyle and similar areas. The growing need for soldiers' coordination, training and health, the increase in asymmetric warfare, suspected geopolitical conflicts and soldiers' modernization programs, among others, are some of the factors that fuel the growth of the military wearables market. Wearable computation plays an important role in improving the capabilities of the soldier. Further, the 5G network promises a solution to the many network and performance challenges in order to adopt more sophisticated wearable technologies in defense automation. In this paper, we conduct a study to identify the role of wearable computing for the defence automation system. We present the taxonomy of wearable computing in defence automation system and explain the relationship of each attribute. In addition, we identify the raise issues and challenges in communication and cybersecurity when deploying the 5G network in defense automation. Furthermore, we propose the design of the wearable smartwatch architecture as a use case of healthcare transformation in defense automation in the 5G environment. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The rapid growth of mobile services and Internet of Things (IoT) has caused severe demands of a management system for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) where User Equipments (UEs) benefit from high computational power, capacity and communication as well as the offered services by MEC. However, a comprehensive management is required to orchestrate the services and resource in MEC to fairly distribute to UEs with the aim of ensuring the Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we propose a decentralization concensus secure and authentication framework for MEC management/orchestration system with crucial security and authentication components by which it ensures the delivery of users’ quality of experience. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Nowadays, the usage of the fog cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) applications among users has been growing progressively. These applications may be E-Transport, E-Healthcare, Augmented Reality, and 3D-Game. Generally, contemporary cloud frameworks offer services based on virtual machines. These frameworks incurred with following issues such as long boot-Time, overhead and unnecessary cost to run the IoT applications. We propose a new Microservice container fog system (MSCFS) based framework to run the mobility and delay-sensitive applications with minimum cost. The study the cost-efficient task scheduling problem in the heterogeneous fog servers. Furthermore, the study introduces the Cost Aware Computational Offloading and task scheduling (CACOTS)framework, which solves the task scheduling into multiple steps. Such as task sequencing step, resource matching step and scheduling step. The experimental results prove that the proposed MSCFS and CACOTS schemes can enhance server utilization. As decrease the services latency and average services bootup time more effectively, and minimize costs. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a psychological disorder caused by high stress from daily life activities. It causes severe health issues, such as sore muscles, low concentration, fatigue, and sleep deprivation. The less availability of predictive solutions specifically for individuals suffering from GAD can become an imperative reason for health and psychological adversity. The proposed solution aims to monitor health, behavioral and environmental parameters of the individual to predict health adversity caused by GAD. Initially, Weighted-Naïve Bayes (W-NB) classifier is utilized to predict irregular health events by classifying the captured data at the fog layer. The proposed two-phased decision-making process helps to optimize the distribution of required medical services by determining the scale of vulnerability. Furthermore, the utility of the framework is increased by calculating health vulnerability index using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System-Genetic Algorithm (ANFIS-GA) on the cloud. The presented work addresses the concerns in terms of efficient monitoring of anomalies followed by time sensitive two-phased alert generation procedure. To approve the performance of irregular event identification and health severity prediction, the framework has been conveyed in a living room for 30 days in which almost 15 individuals by the age of 68 to 78 years have been continuously monitored. The calculated outcomes represent the monitoring efficiency of the proposed framework over the policies of manual monitoring. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Recently, the design and implementation of new healthcare systems have gained an interest in both industry and academia. The amalgamation between the Internet of Things, cloud, edge computing, and big data helps the proliferation of new scenarios for smart medical services and applications. Deep learning is currently paying a lot of attention for its utilization with big healthcare data. To this end, the main objective of this study is to propose a Deep Learning H2O (DLH2O) framework for improving the performance and selection of the optimal features to predict emergency cases. The proposed DLH2O framework consists of data preprocessing layer, feature selection layer and deep learning layer. The DLH2O framework aims to find the optimal subset of features and minimize the error of the classification through a proposed new variant of the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) called ACP-WOA. The proposed changes have been done on the following parameters a, a2, A, and C which should affect both exploration and exploitation of WOA. The experiments conducted in order to test the validity of DLH2O Framework. In regard to the datasets, five experiments are performed for this purpose. The results demonstrate the superiority of ACP-WOA compared to the other state-of-the-art meta-heuristic algorithms in terms of time, error, and scalability. The proposed ACP-WOA is also tested on CEC2017 benchmark functions and proves its superiority over WOA in terms of accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) and smart computing technologies have revolutionized every sphere of 21st century humans. IoT technologies and the data driven services they offer were beyond imagination just a decade ago. Now, they surround us and influence a variety of domains such as automobile, smart home, healthcare, etc. In particular, the Agriculture and Farming industries have also embraced this technological intervention. Smart devices are widely used by a range of people from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies are used in a variety of ways, from finding real-time status of crops and soil moisture content to deploying drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide spray. However, the use of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce a vast exposure to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming environments. Such cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt the economies of countries that are widely dependent on agriculture. In this paper, we present a holistic study on security and privacy in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper outlines a multi layered architecture relevant to the precision agriculture domain and discusses the security and privacy issues in this dynamic and distributed cyber physical environment. Further more, the paper elaborates on potential cyber attack scenarios and highlights open research challenges and future directions. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In the era of Industry 4.0, commoditized services (such as electricity, healthcare, etc.), require accuracy, availability, security and Quality of service (QoS) in the Cloud space. This paper presents cloud advanced metering infrastructure (CAMI) using Zynq UltraScale+ device field programmable gate array (FPGA). The architectural layout for energy tracking and profile measurement is discussed. Unlike existing systems with digital signal processors, it uses precision-based meter reading with encryption driven demand side management (DSM) to protect end-users. An energy service application with supporting hardware prototype is designed. Cryptographic algorithms, dynamic auto-scaling and predictive QoS provisioning are introduced as features of its backend cloud virtualization Infrastructure controller (CVIC). Process integration is achieved with CVIC synthesis for energy analytics and DSM. For the use case scenario, the CAMI prototype runs on Zynq UltraScale+ device with support for end-to-end dataset captures. The system provides on-demand visualization of energy consumption patterns for the end-users. In the experimental setup, two case scenarios demonstrate how the metering system executes fast edge computing profiling. Optimal performance is achieved for latency, utilization, and throughput under CVIC overhead constraint. It was observed that resource utilization responses for heterogeneous and non heterogeneous CVIC are 71.43% and 28.57% respectively. Latency profiles gave 71.43% and 28.57% respectively. With the VM controller, FPGA CAMI offered 47.36% while without VM controller, 52.63% throughput is observed. Consequently, the results highlights how FPGA hardware acceleration can significantly improve request distribution as well as workload processing for cloud based metering systems. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The edge, the fog, the cloud, and even the end-user's devices play a key role in the management of the health sensitive content/data lifecycle. However, the creation and management of solutions including multiple applications executed by multiple users in multiple environments (edge, the fog, and the cloud) to process multiple health repositories that, at the same time, fulfilling non-functional requirements (NFRs) represents a complex challenge for health care organizations. This paper presents the design, development, and implementation of an architectural model to create, on-demand, edge-fog-cloud processing structures to continuously handle big health data and, at the same time, to execute services for fulfilling NFRs. In this model, constructive and modular $blocks$ , implemented as microservices and nanoservices, are recursively interconnected to create edge-fog-cloud processing structures as infrastructure-agnostic services. Continuity schemes create dataflows through the blocks of edge-fog-cloud structures and enforce, in an implicit manner, the fulfillment of NFRs for data arriving and departing to/from each block of each edge-fog-cloud structure. To show the feasibility of this model, a prototype was built using this model, which was evaluated in a case study based on the processing of health data for supporting critical decision-making procedures in remote patient monitoring. This study considered scenarios where end-users and medical staff received insights discovered when processing electrocardiograms (ECGs) produced by sensors in wireless IoT devices as well as where physicians received patient records (spirometry studies, ECGs and tomography images) and warnings raised when online analyzing and identifying anomalies in the analyzed ECG data. A scenario where organizations manage multiple simultaneous each edge-fog-cloud structure for processing of health data and contents delivered to internal and external staff was also studied. The evaluation of these scenarios showed the feasibility of applying this model to the building of solutions interconnecting multiple services/applications managing big health data through different environments. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Indoor localization knows many applications, such as industry 4.0, warehouses, healthcare, drones, etc., where high accuracy becomes more critical than ever. Recent advances in ultra-wideband localization systems allow high accuracies for multiple active users in line-of-sight environments, while they still introduce errors above 300 mm in non-line-of-sight environments due to multi-path effects. Current work tries to improve the localization accuracy of ultra-wideband through offline error correction approaches using popular machine learning techniques. However, these techniques are still limited to simple environments with few multi-path effects and focus on offline correction. With the upcoming demand for high accuracy and low latency indoor localization systems, there is a need to deploy (online) efficient error correction techniques with fast response times in dynamic and complex environments. To address this, we propose (i) a novel semi-supervised autoencoder-based machine learning approach for improving ranging accuracy of ultra-wideband localization beyond the limitations of current improvements while aiming for performance improvements and a small memory footprint and (ii) an edge inference architecture for online UWB ranging error correction. As such, this paper allows the design of accurate localization systems by using machine learning for low-cost edge devices. Compared to a deep neural network (as state-of-the-art, with a baseline error of 75 mm) the proposed autoencoder achieves a 29% higher accuracy. The proposed approach leverages robust and accurate ultra-wideband localization, which reduces the errors from 214 mm without correction to 58 mm with correction. Validation of edge inference using the proposed autoencoder on a NVIDIA Jetson Nano demonstrates significant uplink bandwidth savings and allows up to 20 rapidly ranging anchors per edge GPU. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is the networking of physical devices that are both connected and smart. With the advancement in IoT devices particularly in healthcare sector, huge amount of data is collected from different sensors and all this data are transferred and stored in cloud. It becomes difficult to handle such huge amount of data in cloud specially the healthcare data where it requires real time data computation and storage. Security of the data is also major challenge in cloud. Fog computing is the answer to overcome the challenges. Fog nodes works at the edge side and enhances data security, accuracy, consistency and reduces the latency rate which is an important factor for application like medical data. Even though there are much advantages fog computing also faces some kind of security issues and challenges. Fog-enabled smart health raises a series of challenges in terms of efficient cooperation among healthcare devices, fog nodes, and the cloud server, as well as security and privacy issues. © 2019 SERSC.},

abstract={Emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications share the same characteristics of involving multiple processing components (i.e., function modules) and requiring a massive amount of data to be processed with low latency. To meet these needs, edge/fog computing has been proposed for next-generation mobile networks to migrate the computing from the cloud to the edge of the network. Thanks to the development of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), with which edge computing platform can virtualize function modules and deploy them on any edge devices to provide flexible services on the edge networks. However, such platform would need to deal with complicated function module calling relationship (i.e., call graph) of applications and user mobility, and both are not thoroughly considered by existing works of NFV and edge computing. In this paper, based on our previous idea of virtual local-hub (VLH), we propose a complete design of edge computing framework, which applies NFV technology on edge computing environment for IoT applications. To handle the complicated call graphs of IoT applications with better resource utilization, the VLH framework adapts the technologies of container-based virtualization and microservice architecture, which enables remote function module sharing on the edge computing environment. The framework includes the heuristic algorithm for function module allocation with the objective of minimizing total bandwidth consumption. We also present a design of protocols for system operations and mobility handling in the framework. Then we implement the framework on commodity hardware as a testbed. Via simulations under a large-scale environment with practical settings and experiments on the testbed under real-world scenarios, we demonstrate and verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed VLH framework for IoT application service provision. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Access to healthcare services is one of the fundamental pillars of society today. People either have access to healthcare or they are not privileged enough to visit a doctor. In underprivileged societies, access to healthcare is difficult due to various reasons such as fewer number of doctors and healthcare facilities, inefficient communication means, and so on. This may result in exaggeration of the disease or threat to life. On the other hand, those who are privileged, end up paying unnecessary visits to the physician in most of the cases on an average (>71% in USA), and incurring high costs. Often-times, health issues are minor, and it is not necessary to visit a doctor. In such a case, the patient only requires suggestions on quick health fix, or some precautionary measures. Such information can be provided through the combination of a smartphone-based app, fog/edge computing, and mobile communication. Hence, reaching out to the doctors in their available time (off-time, commuting via public transit, so on) when they can answer some quick questions is one of the solutions that fit into smart healthcare definition, and truly pervasive healthcare. In this paper, we propose an innovative healthcare service architecture, called opportunistic healthcare (oHealth), where health log and questions can be opportunistically offloaded to a nearby (such as at public transit) compute entity (such as fog server) capable of processing health logs (up to 234,729 logs daily as per our setup). The fog node communicates the questions to a doctor, who provides the necessary feedback.

abstract={Disease prevention and health management is becoming the key focus of diagnostic medicine these days rather than focusing on treatment after the infliction. Research advancements in using Artificial Intelligence for healthcare has enabled personalized diagnostic and treatment applications for disease identification, management and prevention. What was previously limited due to vast amount of data has now been possible because of Deep Neural Networks and their application for modeling complex diagnostic decisions. Mobile healthcare applications powered by Deep Neural Networks has enabled people to triage their conditions and make preemptive treatment decisions. In this paper, we reviewed recent advancements done in mobile healthcare applications using deep learning in the past 2-3 years and classified these implementations into three major categories: Cloud-computing assisted mobile healthcare systems, Edge-computing assisted mobile healthcare systems and offline mobile healthcare systems. Furthermore, based on the recent literature, we identified an initial framework that most mobile healthcare applications using deep learning employ. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Smart healthcare monitoring systems provide better healthcare service by improving the availability and transparency of health data. However, it also posses serious threats to data security and privacy. As medical internet of things (IoT) are connected to other devices through various networks that provide a suitable attack surface for the intruders. Further, the health data are sensitive, and any breach in security may lead to wrong treatment or compromising the privacy of the patients. In this regard, a secure IoT frame is desirable, which is capable of preserving the integrity and confidentiality of the medical data. In this paper, we have proposed a novel architecture which leverages the blockchain technology to enhance the security and privacy of IoT for healthcare applications. In the proposed architecture called smart healthcare system for patients in ICU (SHPI), critical data is processed in edge computing which is located inside the hospital to reduce the communication latency. In order to provide tramper-proof medical records and data confidentiality SHPI uses blockchain technology and cryptographic methods respectively. Also, a data accessing token system is introduced to separate the group of users based on their roles. This system utilizes smart contracts to record every event for providing transparency in medical activities. In order to describe the working principles a logical analysis is carried out, that shows the system is capable of providing the desired security and privacy. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) facilitates creation of smart spaces by converting existing environments into sensor-rich data-centric cyber-physical systems with an increasing degree of automation, giving rise to Industry 4.0. When adopted in commercial/industrial contexts, this trend is revolutionising many aspects of our everyday life, including the way people access and receive healthcare services. As we move towards Healthcare Industry 4.0, the underlying IoT systems of Smart Healthcare spaces are growing in size and complexity, making it important to ensure that extreme amounts of collected data are properly processed to provide valuable insights and decisions according to requirements in place. This paper focuses on the Smart Healthcare domain and addresses the issue of data fusion in the context of IoT networks, consisting of edge devices, network and communications units, and Cloud platforms. We propose a distributed hierarchical data fusion architecture, in which different data sources are combined at each level of the IoT taxonomy to produce timely and accurate results. This way, mission-critical decisions, as demonstrated by the presented Smart Healthcare scenario, are taken with minimum time delay, as soon as necessary information is generated and collected. The proposed approach was implemented using the Complex Event Processing technology, which natively supports the hierarchical processing model and specifically focuses on handling streaming data ‘on the fly’—a key requirement for storage-limited IoT devices and time-critical application domains.

abstract={Due to the shortage and unbalance of medical resources, it is difficult for patients in the countryside to get high-quality and timely medical services from the central medical facility. Existing researches of fog e-health has the potential of providing real-time medical services for the countryside with body sensor networks (BSN), but there are two limitations. On one hand, because of the medical services requiring not only low-latency but also high-quality, constructing an AI e-health service on resource-constrained fog with edge AI is necessary but unsolved. On the other hand, because of the regional differences in disease risk, there is a lack of an effective mechanism to provide a customized fog AI e-health service for patients in different regions. To address these issues, a smart customized e-health (SCEH) framework is proposed in this paper to provide edge-intelligent and customized medical services for the countryside. Firstly, semantics-based lightweight and meticulous load management mechanism is designed to reduce data load and involve medical semantic. Secondly, model-ensemble based fog AI collaborative analysis mechanism is proposed for load balance and knowledge integration. Thirdly, an attention-weight based customized fog AI e-health generation mechanism is devised for regional medical model reconstruction. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of SCEH which ensures both the accuracy and low latency of fog e-health with limited resource. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a current paradigm which can be part of several fields of application, and Healthcare is one of the most important. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is an important subfield in Healthcare. Also, services demand and network requirements of IoT systems due to the increase of connected devices and data flow overcharges Cloud. Fog Computing represents a new paradigm that lightens the network. Some applications use Fog Computing in order to reduce costs and improve performance of IoT applications. Healthcare is one of them and the implementation of Fog Computing architectures inside those systems is a new trend nowadays. The importance of having a data infrastructure in this kind of IoT systems is evident because of the relevance of the data. In this paper is presented a Data Infrastructure for Managing Information Obtained from Ambient Assisted Living. The model provides the data flow starting in the data reading in the IoT devices and ending in the Cloud by crossing Fog Computing Layer. The model considers communication protocols, security features and relationship between elements which take part in an AAL system. Moreover, the model was developed using Eclipse Modeling Tool and validated in the same tool by using an instantiation of the main classes of the model. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={In modern e-Healthcare systems, human activity recognition (HAR) is one of the most challenging tasks in remote monitoring of patients suffering from mental illness or disabilities for necessary assistance. One of the major issues is to provide security to a number of different connected devices to the Internet, known as Internet of Things (IoT). A potential solution to this problem is the blockchain-based architecture. In addition, the complex nature of activities performed by humans in diverse healthcare environments reduces the qualitative measures for extracting distinct features representing various human actions. To answer this challenge, we propose an activity monitoring and recognition framework, which is based on multi-class cooperative categorization procedure to improve the activity classification accuracy in videos supporting the fog or cloud computing-based blockchain architecture. In the proposed approach, frame-based salient features are extracted from videos consisting of different human activities, which are further processed into action vocabulary for efficiency and accuracy. Similarly, the classification of activities is performed using support vector machine (SVM) based on the error-correction-output-codes (ECOC) framework. It has been observed through experimental results that the proposed approach is more efficient and achieves higher accuracy regarding human activity recognition as compared to other state-of-the-art action recognition approaches. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Fog computing (alternatively known as Edge computing) is a new paradigm that can be used near mobile devices to perform computational tasks effectively and efficiently. There can be many possible computational models for mobile devices using fog computing to get the tasks done. A smart city is a framework where mobile devices such as smartphones, smart wearable devices, mobile computing devices and many more communicate with each other, with neighboring devices and with other infrastructure such as wireless access points deployed in the city to use services and facilities provided within the smart city. A key requirement of any smart city is the availability of a seamless, reliable, secure broadband wireless network to support the services provided by the municipalities as well as other commercial service providers. An example of such potential wireless networks is new 5G technology that is being tested currently and will be available commercially in the near future. The objective of a smart city is to provide excellent quality of life to its residents using such new technologies through sustainable means. In this paper, we address the research question that what will be the role of fog computing in a smart city where 5G enabled wireless technology is used. We present a conceptual model called Smart-City-Fog model and describe its functionalities in the context of smart cities. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The rapid development of the wearable technology brings an explosive growth of wearable devices and imposes a new challenge to the current network. This is because the wearable devices require real-time interaction and data processing. To cope with this challenge and to realize reasonable utilization of resources, this paper first introduces the network slice-based 5G wearable networks, including the 5G ultra-dense cellular network, the edge caching, and the edge computing. Then, in order to realize the service aware and efficient management of network slicing resources, we propose a data-driven resource management framework which includes the service cognitive engine, the resources cognitive engine, and the global cognitive engine. Furthermore, through information perception, analytical prediction, policy decisions, and performance evaluation, the data-driven resources management method is realized. Finally, we set up a real testbed and conduct a related experiment. The experimental results show that the data-driven resources management scheme can realize the service-aware resources allocation and improve the utilization ratio of resources. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

In order to meet the new needs or challenges, we have found that it’s necessary to review the previously proposed architectures in the literature, in order to make technological improvements. Indeed, in this paper, we propose a secure architecture based on Blockchain technology, scalable with the use of Fog computing technology and allowing the processing and storage of data using a cloud. In addition, the proposed architecture is easy to deploy due to its three-layers: perception layer, network layer and application layer. We also describe the main challenges for the prototyping of the proposed architecture. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The number of zero-day attacks has been exponentially increasing due to a variety of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) protocols. Many centralized-based techniques have been introduced to identify malicious activities in IoT environments. However, these techniques have suffered including a high latency to satisfy IoT requirements. This paper proposes a fog-based attack detection (FBAD) framework using an ensemble of online sequential extreme learning machine (EOS-ELM) for efficiently detecting malicious activities. We indicate a high-level view of the efficient proposed framework for deploying the distributed attack detection technique in fog computing due to high accuracy and low latency, as it is closer to the IoT devices at the network edge. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our framework with other existing approaches including ELM and OS-ELM. The results of the experiment demonstrate that distributed architecture outperforms centralized architecture in terms of the detection time and classification accuracy. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Edge Computing represents the activities of IoT (Internet of Things) devices at the border or limit of the network connected to the remote Cloud. The latest research in this field has intended to demonstrate that Edge Computing architectures are the optimal solution to minimising latency, improving privacy and reducing bandwidth costs in IoT-based scenarios. This article is a review of the Edge Computing technology and its reference architectures proposed by the Edge Computing Consortium, Intel-SAP, the FAR-Edge Project and the Industrial Internet Consortium for Industry 4.0. Moreover, this article presents a proposal for a tiered architecture with a modular approach that allows to manage the complexity of solutions not only for Industry 4.0 environments but also for other scenarios such as smart cities, smart energy, healthcare or precision agrotechnology. The main contributions of the proposed architecture reside in the security and privacy provided by blockchain technologies. Finally, the proposed reference architecture is tested by building an IoT platform in a smart agroindustry scenario to reduce bandwidth costs between the Edge and the Cloud. © 2019},

abstract={The popularity of wearable devices and smartphones has fueled the development of Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR), which provides immersive experiences over the real world using techniques, such as computer vision and deep learning. However, the hardware-specific MAR is costly and heavy, and the App-based MAR requires an additional download and installation and it also lacks cross-platform ability. These limitations hamper the pervasive promotion of MAR. This paper argues that mobile Web AR (MWAR) holds the potential to become a practical and pervasive solution that can effectively scale to millions of end-users because MWAR can be developed as a lightweight, cross-platform, and low-cost solution for end-to-end delivery of MAR. The main challenges for making MWAR a reality lie in the low efficiency for dense computing in Web browsers, a large delay for real-time interactions over mobile networks, and the lack of standardization. The good news is that the newly emerging 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) cellular networks can mitigate these issues to some extent via techniques such as network slicing, device-to-device communication, and mobile edge computing. In this paper, we first give an overview of the challenges and opportunities of MWAR in the 5G era. Then we describe our design and development of a generic service-oriented framework (called MWAR5) to provide a scalable, flexible, and easy to deploy MWAR solution. We evaluate the performance of our MWAR5 system in an actually deployed 5G trial network under the collaborative configurations, which shows encouraging results. Moreover, we also share the experiences and insights from our development and deployment, including some exciting future directions of MWAR over 5G and B5G networks. © 2013 China Institute of Communications.},

abstract={Developments in the internet of things technology (IoT) have greatly influenced the way we live and have been seen in a variety of application areas, including health care. Most of the papers reviewed dealt with some health care services, and there is little scientific literature on the application or implementation of IoT in cancer detection and treatment services. This encouraged us to (re) evaluate the provision of health-care services and their location to harness the benefits associated with the use of IoT. Also, the lateness which caused by transmitting data to the cloud and back to the application is inadmissible for healthcare systems which based on IoT. As well, it is not efficient to transmit so much data to the cloud for processing and storage, because it would saturate network bandwidth and not be scalable. This also encouraged us to use fog computing which take advantages of cloud resources and coordinate the utilization of geographically distributed edge devices. So, this paper proposes the implementation of healthcare system which based on IoT and fog computing technologies for averting the spread of cancer via early detection, evaluation of disease's symptoms, and also analyzing health data that gathered from IoT through various sensor networks and other smart devices to help healthcare professionals to turn a stream of data into actionable insights and evidence-based healthcare decision-making to improve and enhance cancer treatment. Due to the similarity of the general symptoms of cancer with some other diseases, we also proposed a neutrosophic multi-criteria decision making technique for assisting healthcare professionals to predict disease that patient may be suffers from if he/she does not have cancer. This technique depends on gathered data from proposed healthcare system and able to handle uncertainty of imprecision and ambiguity which resulted from the proportional priority scales of different symptoms of disease. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The demand for prehospital emergency care has increased during the last decades throughout the Western world, in terms of numbers of emergency calls and dispatched ambulances. This development represents a challenge for both the prehospital emergency systems and the emergency departments at the hospitals [1]. Stroke is the fourth single leading cause of death in the UK and an accurate recognition of stroke by in-ambulance or emergency medical services (EMS) or prehospital ambulance paramedics, offers significant potential to reduce delays in presentation and treatment in acute stroke [2]. This paper demonstrates Proof-of-Concept (PoC) approaches for 5G network slicing in mission-critical use cases from the H2020 5G PPP SliceNet project, which is implementing an End-to-End (E2E) cognitive network slicing and slice management framework in virtualised multi-domain, multi-tenant 5G Networks. The paper shows how the PoC's key enablers, such as QoS-aware network slicing, edge computing and hardware acceleration, can assist with a continuous collection, processing and streaming of patient data that could shorten the time to assess and provide optimal clinical treatment pathways for potential stroke patients. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Ever since the boost realized in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), market is flooded with high-end multi-tasking devices, presenting a real-time computational environment for technologies like Internet of Things (IoT). With computation at user-end, it provides a fog-based computing paradigm to generate time senstive results, which along with cloud storage presents a comprehensive Fog-Cloud computing paradigm. Because of these reasons, the work presented in this paper focuses on utilizing the potential of IoT Technology to provide a novel Fog-Cloud architecture for efficient healthcare services in smart office. Specifically, a Fog-Cloud architecture has been proposed to monitor and analyze various health attributes of a person during his working hours. Moreover, the framework indulges various activities in the ambient office environment with the purpose of analyzing it for health severity. In order to realize this, a probabilistic measure, named as Severity Index (SI) is defined to evaluate the adverse effects of different activities on personal health. Finally, an application scenario of temporal healthcare predictive monitoring and alert generation is discussed to depict the ideology of Smart Office Healthcare. In order to validate the system, an experimental implmentation is performed on heterogenous datasets. The results obtained in comparison to state-of-the-art techniques show that the proposed model is highly efficient and accurate for providing appropriate healthcare environment during working hours of a person in a smart office. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The world has recently witnessed the emergence of huge technological growth in the field of data transmission and smart living through various modes of information and communication technology. For example, edge computing has taken a leading role to embark upon the problems related to the internetwork bandwidth minimization and service latency reduction. Inclusion of small microcontroller chips, smart sensors and actuators in the existing socio-economic sectors have paved the Internet of Things (IoT) to act upon the dissemination of smart services to the end users. Thus, a strong need of understating of the industrial elements of edge computing has become necessary that can share the mutual goal while assimilating with the IoT. This paper advocates the crucial role of industrial standards and elements of the edge computing for the dissemination of overwhelming augmented user experience with conjunction with the IoT. First, we present the taxonomical classification and review the industrial aspects that can benefit from both of the IoT and edge computing scenario, then discuss about each of the taxonomical components in detail. Second, we present two practically implemented use cases that have recently employed the edge-IoT paradigm together to solve urban smart living problems. Third, we propose a novel edge-IoT based architecture for e-healthcare i.e. EH-IoT and developed a demo test-bed. The test results showed promising results towards minimizing dependency over IoT cloud analytics or storage facility. We conclude with discussion on the various parameters such as, architecture, requirement capability, functional issues, and selection criteria, related to the survival of edge-IoT ecosystem incorporation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Heart failure is one of the most common cause of death in the world. The real-time health monitoring system with the advent of the Internet of things has attracted growing attention in the health care industry, which can help reducing the death rate of heart failure. Despite the recent success of these efforts, there have been some limitations, such as response time, scalability, latency and fault tolerance. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical architecture with four layers to develop health care systems. In the proposed model, the vital signs of a patient are measured by means of a body sensor network and sent to a smart health care system. Each of these layers is related to a certain level of heart failure. Therefore, in the proposed model, simple and low-risk heart failure can be detected quickly before it reaches to a dangerous level. Empirical results confirm a significant improvement in terms of response time and scalability in comparison with the state of the art techniques. © 2019},

abstract={The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has paved the way for many cloud based applications such as smart grid, healthcare, traffic management, finance, etc. In this vein, the need of transferring large data-streams to remote data centers is a key concern for modern Cloud-based IoT paradigms. This disrupts the remote Cloud Computing model, moving applications, data and computing resources to the logical extremes of the network. Thus, to handle streaming data in IoT environments, an efficient IoT-based computing model that can dynamically handle the interplay between Cloud and Edge data centers is required. In this direction, a recent paradigm, popularly known as Osmotic Computing, has emerged to ensure the acceptable performance of widely dispersed services. However, the burden of data-offloading across multiple data centers usually leads to a consequent increase in their energy consumption which in-turn will affect the overall Quality of Service (QoS) of the IoT-based applications. Keeping focus on all these issues, a consolidated decision making framework for Osmotic Computing, i.e., En-OsCo, is designed to ensure the energy-aware dynamic management of resources. The proposed framework incorporates four significant contributions: i) Resource monitoring of Edge data centers using Extended Kalman Filter, ii) Optimal dispatch of incoming services to the Edge/Cloud setup using Hyper-heuristics, iii) Minimizing the energy consumption of underlying data centers and reducing the service latency, and iv) Reducing the search space of Hyper-heuristics by keeping track of previously made decisions using Universal Streaming Monitoring. Further, in order to validate the efficacy of the proposed En-OsCo framework, ContainerCloudSim has been used in combination of HyFlex on PlanetLab datasets. The obtained results validate the purpose of the proposed scheme in minimizing the overall energy consumption of the computing setup while considerably reducing the latency. © 2019 ACM.},

abstract={Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) based healthcare applications are categorized as those delay-sensitive online services that could not tolerate delay because of its negative and dangerous consequences on people's lives. Hence, many researchers try to propose novel approaches in order to improve the Quality of Service in online healthcare systems. As the network architecture plays an important role in providing a suitable level of QoS for any kind of applications, we aim to evaluate the performance of two different paradigms with different architectures, namely Cloud and Fog computing on performance of a WBSN based healthcare application. Using Cloud architecture for processing and storage of provided data by WBSNs has been deeply discussed in the literature. As Cloud resources are only accessible through the Internet, any network failure or Internet disconnection causes a high response time which is not tolerable by healthcare applications. In this paper, we investigate the role of Fog computing on reducing the response time and Internet traffic for a WBSN based healthcare application in a real-world test-bed. The achieved results show that in comparison to Cloud, the Fog-based architecture reduces the response time and Internet traffic by 46% and 77% respectively. © 2019 IEEE},

abstract={Remote healthcare monitoring has exponentially grown over the past decade together with the increasing penetration of Internet of Things (IoT) platforms. IoT-based health systems help to improve the quality of healthcare services through real-time data acquisition and processing. However, traditional IoT architectures have some limitations. For instance, they cannot properly function in areas with poor or unstable Internet. Low power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies, including long-range communication protocols such as LoRa, are a potential candidate to overcome the lacking network infrastructure. Nevertheless, LPWANs have limited transmission bandwidth not suitable for high data rate applications such as fall detection systems or electrocardiography monitoring. Therefore, data processing and compression are required at the edge of the network. We propose a system architecture with integrated artificial intelligence that combines Edge and Fog computing, LPWAN technology, IoT and deep learning algorithms to perform health monitoring tasks. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this architecture via a use case of fall detection using recurrent neural networks. We have implemented a fall detection system from the sensor node and Edge gateway to cloud services and end-user applications. The system uses inertial data as input and achieves an average precision of over 90% and an average recall over 95% in fall detection. © 2019 IEEE.},

The present method used to manage this information is a technology named as cloud computing. Though, due to its necessity of data centers, this can become infeasible for the handling of information from the internet of things due to space among these IOT keen items and the data center. Present growths in ICTs like in Internet-of-Things and Cyber-Physical Systems grow healthcare answers with brighter and forecast abilities together for home, office and also in hospitals. In the maximum of IoT-based healthcare organizations, particularly at smooth households or clinics, a linking opinion is required among sensor organization system and the Internet. The fog computing is attaining attention in the area of health care with the IOT. The goal of the research is to present skills called fog computing with IOT in the arena of healthcare. The author discussed a framework to improve fog performance via a collective rule amongst fog knots to attain the best load and job distribution. In the paper, fog computing is measured as an addition of the cloud computing to the verge of the system, which is an extremely virtualized stage of source pool that delivers calculation, storage, and networking facilities to adjacent end consumers. © 2019 International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

abstract={Cloud computing technologies such as virtualization and orchestration have revolutionized a great number of different domains, from the industry to healthcare. However, there are still certain applications that can not take advantage of this paradigm due to stricter requirements such as end-to-end response times. A new paradigm called Fog computing is arising to answer the needs of these applications. Fog nodes have lower hardware resources that their Cloud counterparts and are distributed over a wider geographical area. Porting technologies designed for the Cloud, specifically orchestration, to this new paradigm requires to handle these peculiarities. A novel orchestration architecture is proposed evolving on current ones, directly focusing Fog characteristics. Multiple schedulers are dynamically deployed in order to achieve a better scheduling throughput and spread the resources required by the scheduler among multiple lower-resource nodes. It uses an application-centric approach at the scheduler level in order to enable new scheduling parameters. The scheduling throughput of this architecture is compared to the most common Cloud orchestration architecture. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The use of machine learning modeling techniques enables smart IoT applications in geo-distributed infrastructures such as in the areas of Industry 4.0, smart cities, autonomous driving, and telemedicine. The data for these models is continuously emitted by sensor-equipped devices. It is usually unlabeled and commonly has dynamically-changing data distribution, which impedes the learning process. However, many critical applications such as telemedicine require highly accurate models and human supervision. Therefore, online supervised learning is often utilized, but its application remains challenging as it requires continuous labeling by experts, which is expensive. To reduce the cost, active learning (AL) strategies are used for efficient data selection and labeling. In this paper we propose a novel AL framework for IoT applications, which employs data selection strategies throughout the multiple layers of distributed IoT architectures. This enables an improved utilization of the available resources and reduces costs. The results from the evaluation using classification and regression tasks and synthetic as well as real-world datasets in multiple settings show that the use of multilayer AL can significantly reduce communication, expert costs, and energy, without a loss in model performance. We believe that this study motivates the development of new techniques that employ selective sampling strategies on data streams to optimize the resource usage in IoT architectures. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) systems open up massive versatility and opportunity to our world. Providing solutions for smart cities, healthcare, energy, and mobility, such systems increasingly permeate critical aspects of human activity. In a flourish of growth, these complex systems run software, are dynamic, without stable spatial and temporal boundaries, and involve mostly independent software components with different lifespans and evolution models. IoT systems provide data-centric, device-centric and service-centric functionalities that are subject to continuous disruption, under limitations such as resource-constrained devices, platforms heterogeneity, deployment in adverse environments and administrative domains. As these systems evolve and gain complexity, resilience becomes a crucial system property. Bolstering resilience entails understanding and systematically managing dynamic behavior and decentralizing operations. We advocate that to systematically engineer resilience in IoT systems, a complete rethink is necessary regarding their design and operation. In this paradigm shift, systems demand conceptual frameworks, techniques, and mathematically-backed formalisms to treat change and achieve decentralization. We outline a vision for addressing fundamental challenges that software engineering and distributed systems research encounters when building resilient IoT systems. Within a roadmap, we identify techniques and methods that can be leveraged to maintain resilience in the face of disruption, especially in the absence of central control and persistently at the system's runtime. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The architectural framework of Fog and edge computing reveals that the network components which lie between the cloud and devices computes application oriented operations. In this paper, an in-depth review of fog and mist computing in the area of health care informatics is analyzed, classified, and discussed various applications cited in the literature. For that purpose, applications are classified into different categories and a list of application-oriented tasks that can be handled by fog and edge computing are enlisted. It is further added that on which layer of the network system such fog and edge computing tasks can be computed and trade-offs with respect to requirements relevant to healthcare are provided. The review undertaken in this paper focuses on three important areas: firstly, the enormous amount of computing tasks of healthcare system can take mileage of these two computing principles; secondly, the limitation of wireless devices can be overcome by having higher network tiers which can execute tasks and aggregate the data; and thirdly, privacy concerns and dependability prevent computation tasks to completely move to the cloud. Another area which has been considered in the study is how Edge and Fog computing can make the security algorithms more efficient. The findings of the study provide evidence of the need for a logical and consistent approach towards fog and mist computing in healthcare system. © 2019 SCPE.},

abstract={Healthcare data streams originate from various sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) devices deployed in medical equipment and healthcare facilities as well as worn by patients. These vast volumes of data need to be leveraged to improve patient care, optimize processes, and help health sector stakeholders and applications make faster and more informed decisions. Many healthcare applications use the power of the cloud for data processing. However, time-sensitive healthcare applications cannot tolerate sending data streams to the cloud for processing due to unacceptable high latency and network bandwidth requirements. Healthcare facilities and caregivers need the ability to efficiently stream data and process data streams in real-time at the edge. This paper describes a five-tier architecture that aims to deal with the streaming and processing of data generated by the various devices and equipment of healthcare facilities and systems to enable the creation of smart healthcare applications. The architecture is based on emerging and established technologies, including IoT, edge/fog computing, data integration techniques, cloud computing, and data analytics. The proposed architecture will facilitate the creation of healthcare applications for real-time event detection, notification of alerts, and building monitoring dashboards. Fog node components include an advanced and widely recognized distributed messaging system, Apache Kafka, and the popular stream processing engine, Apache Storm, capable of processing large amounts of data. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={In the backdrop of an emerging scenario marked by a predominantly older populace, burgeoning costs of living amidst depleting resources, Cloud computing and IoT offer a ray of hope, particularly while developing e-Health system, with patient at the core of the healthcare pyramid. Telemedicine is a novel application that offers healthcare services such as diagnosis, consultation as well as treatment that reaches the most efficient levels with introduction of smart healthcare solutions. Nonetheless, IoT-driven healthcare requires to conquer multiple hurdles like complexities in data storage on cloud servers, security and privacy aspects, prohibitively high expenses incurred on perpetual data accumulation, other than energy-efficiency challenges and maintenance of sensors based out of cloud servers. In this paper, the primary focus is on devising a novel construct around the concept, Fog computing, particularly from the point of view of Tele medical IoT. As is commonly understood, Fog computing as a prototype allows cloud computing services to reach the periphery of a network. In a manner identical to cloud, Fog enables end users to receive data, computation, storage, and application services. As a case study, in this paper, an attempt has been made to develop a service-oriented architecture that monitors and accelerates healing in cases of bone fracture applying fog computing. In fact,, this architecture applies a sensing module on an energy-efficient embedded computer to perform data mining and data analytics operation on raw data that is sourced from sensing modules utilized in such telehealth operations. This embedded computer system assembles such sensed data in a time series before analyzing and discovering the identical patterns, which later stores, extracts novel patterns as well as transmits clinically-suitable data via network to the cloud based in a hospital. © BEIESP.},

abstract={Automatically recognizing emotions of patients can be a good facilitator of a connected healthcare framework. It can give automatic feedback to the stakeholders of the healthcare industry about patients' states and satisfaction levels. In this article, we propose an automatic audio-visual emotion recognition system in a connected healthcare framework. The system uses a 2D CNN model for the speech modality and a 3D CNN model for the visual modality. For the speech signal, preprocessing is done to extract the PS-PA feature vector. The features from the two CNN models are blended by two ELM networks. The first ELM is trained with gender-specific data, while the other one is trained with emotion-specific data. The proposed system is evaluated using three databases, and the experiments prove the success of the system. In the healthcare framework, we use edge computing prior to intensive-processing cloud computing. In the edge computing, we realize edge caching, which can store the CNN model parameters and thereby perform the testing fast. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Mobile edge computing helps healthcare Internet of Things (IoT) devices with energy harvesting provide satisfactory quality of experiences for computation intensive applications. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based privacy-aware offloading scheme to help healthcare IoT devices protect both the user location privacy and the usage pattern privacy. More specifically, this scheme enables a healthcare IoT device to choose the offloading rate that improves the computation performance, protects user privacy, and saves the energy of the IoT device without being aware of the privacy leakage, IoT energy consumption, and edge computation model. This scheme uses transfer learning to reduce the random exploration at the initial learning process and applies a Dyna architecture that provides simulated offloading experiences to accelerate the learning process. A post-decision state learning method uses the known channel state model to further improve the offloading performance. We provide the performance bound of this scheme regarding the privacy level, the energy consumption, and the computation latency for three typical healthcare IoT offloading scenarios. Simulation results show that this scheme can reduce the computation latency, save the energy consumption, and improve the privacy level of the healthcare IoT device compared with the benchmark scheme. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Rapid developments in the fields of information and communication technology and microelectronics allowed seamless interconnection among various devices letting them to communicate with each other. This technological integration opened up new possibilities in many disciplines including healthcare and well-being. With the aim of reducing healthcare costs and providing improved and reliable services, several healthcare frameworks based on Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) have been developed. However, due to the critical and heterogeneous nature of healthcare data, maintaining high quality of service (QoS) - in terms of faster responsiveness and data-specific complex analytics - has always been the main challenge in designing such systems. Addressing these issues, this paper proposes a five-layered heterogeneous mist, fog, and cloud-based IoHT framework capable of efficiently handling and routing (near-)real-time as well as offline/batch mode data. Also, by employing software defined networking and link adaptation-based load balancing, the framework ensures optimal resource allocation and efficient resource utilization. The results, obtained by simulating the framework, indicate that the designed network via its various components can achieve high QoS, with reduced end-to-end latency and packet drop rate, which is essential for developing next generation e -healthcare systems. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In the past few years, a rapid increase in the number of patients requiring constant monitoring, which inspires researchers to develop intelligent and sustainable remote smart healthcare services. However, the transmission of big real-time health data is a challenge since the current dynamic networks are limited by different aspects such as the bandwidth, end-to-end delay, and transmission energy. Due to this, a data reduction technique should be applied to the data before being transmitted based on the resources of the network. In this paper, we integrate efficient data reduction with wireless networking transmission to enable an adaptive compression with an acceptable distortion, while reacting to the wireless network dynamics such as channel fading and user mobility. Convolutional Auto-encoder (CAE) approach was used to implement an adaptive compression/reconstruction technique with the minimum distortion. Then, a resource allocation framework was implemented to minimize the transmission energy along with the distortion of the reconstructed signal while considering different network and applications constraints. A comparison between the results of the resource allocation framework considering both CAE and Discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) was also captured. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Smartwatches have finally come of age and represent a unique platform for building IoT applications involving people. Today, smartwatches are used in various IoT scenarios including healthcare and fitness. Since the current smartwatches are equipped with a variety of sensors and heterogenous wireless protocols, they can be used to enact a variety of people-based Social Internet of Things (SIoT). Such applications involve sending sensor data from millions of watches through the IoT cloud. Processors on current watches are powerful enough to run even deep learning algorithms and may support peak download data rates of more than 50 Mbits/second. However, battery life remains a limiting factor. Most smartwatch applications capture and process context. This paper provides a survey and framework based on context computation, edge analytics, and computation off-loading as applied to IoT applications using smartwatches. This framework can be a basis of meaningful discussion of various solutions to address various technical problems like short battery life of smartwatches when used in IoT applications. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Wearables that acquire relevant vital and contextual parameters improve work safety as well as quality of life of elderly citizens or patients with chronic diseases. A scalable architecture connects wearables via a hub to the cloud and combines edge with cloud computing to provide optimal user interaction and allow analytics on multi-stream data. The functionality was expanded to enable demonstrations of physiological and psychological stress classification in firemen and mobile health interventions in patients with lung diseases. Following an initial table-top edge demonstrator a hemi-spherical display improves emotional contact to users. A first use case tested an integrated acquisition and inference system that was trained to differentiate physical and emotional stress. The system measured stress in firemen during training in a cage maze and in hot training locations and provided functions to acquire expert labels. A second use case focused on mobile-health intervention for patients suffering from Chronic-Obstructive-Pulmonary-Disease (COPD), to improve their quality-of-life. Patient-physician conversations are extended through a communication channel and a virtual assistant provides disease related information, reminders, and alerts. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Maintenance is an important aspect of the entire life cycle of communication network devices. The existing maintenance environment of the communication network is complex, with various types of equipment components and complicated structures. The quality of maintenance is greatly affected by the ability and experience of on-site maintenance personnel, and the maintenance cost is high, and the efficiency is low. In order to decrease the difficulty of on-site maintenance and improve maintenance efficiency and quality, we proposed an augmented reality (AR) based edge maintenance architecture. Moreover, we propose a context model-based maintenance knowledge push algorithm (CMKP) to help on-site maintenance personnel obtain auxiliary information. This will provide on-site maintenance personnel with intelligent assistance and improve overall maintenance efficiency. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery},

abstract={In the current decade, ambient assisted living is attracting widespread interest due to the rapidly aging global population. The cloud-based Internet of things (IoT) healthcare systems are facing many barriers to handle the big healthcare data that IoT generates. Edge of things computing is one of the promising solutions. Accordingly, this paper proposes a hybrid ambient assisted living framework with naïve Bayes–firefly algorithm (HAAL-NBFA) for monitoring elderly patients suffering from chronic diseases. This architecture exploits the current advances in the IoT by using ambient and biomedical sensors to collect the data of the elderly patient and then fuse it into context states to predict the health status of the patient in real time using context-awareness techniques. The proposed HAAL-NBFA framework proposes a five-phase classification technique to handle big imbalanced datasets resulting from long-term monitoring of elderly patients. In this paper, the firefly algorithm (FA) has been used to optimize naïve Bayes classifier (NB) which selects the minimum features that give the highest accuracy. The proposed NB-FA acts as a safe-fail module that decides when to stop the system and when to permit its continuation in case of sensor’s failure. The experimental results proved that the proposed HAAL-NBFA had achieved high accuracy and sensitivity in predicting the health status of patients suffering from blood pressure (BP) disorders. Furthermore, the importance of NB-FA in accelerating classifications and maintaining the continuity of HAAL-NBFA’s operation has been proved by experimental results. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.},

abstract={To improve the living standard of urban communities and to render the healthcare services sustainable and efficient, e-health system is experiencing a paradigm shift. Patients with cognitive discrepancies can be monitored and observed through the analyses of power consumption of home appliances. This paper surveys recent trends in home-based e-health services using metered energy consumption data. It also analyses and summarizes the constant impedance, constant current and constant power (ZIP) approaches for load modelling. The analysis briefly recaptures both non-intrusive and intrusive techniques. The work reports an architecture using IoT technologies for the design of a smart-meter, and fog-computing paradigm for raw processing of energy dataset. Finally, the paper describes the implementation platform based on GirdLAB-D simulation to construct accurate models of household appliances and test the machine-learning algorithm for the detection of abnormal behaviour. © 2019 The authors.},

abstract={Cloud-Fog computing architectures are new paradigms designed to add advantages to the existing architectures for Internet of Things (IoT). This paper proposes an inter-operable cloud-fog based IoT architecture for healthcare. It describes its architecture, environmental context, and user context. The proposed architecture supports the mobility of the patients as well as the diversity of the medical cases. The features of the individual modules are discussed and the interconnection between the different underlying modules and tiers is explained. Task scheduling and allocation approach is proposed to effectively balance healthcare tasks distribution. The performance evaluation of the proposed approach is presented with different number of tasks and cloud nodes. The simulation results show acceptable results in terms of miss ratio, cost, and latency. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) offers innovative solutions to a healthier life, making radical changes in people's lives. Healthcare providers are enabled to continuously and remotely monitor their patients for many medial issues outside hospitals and healthcare providers' offices. MIoT systems and applications lead to increase availability, accessibility, quality and cost-effectiveness of healthcare services. On the other hand, MIoT devices generate a large amount of diverse real-time data, which is highly sensitive. Thus, securing medical data is an essential requirement when developing MIoT architectures. However, the MIoT architectures being developed in the literature have many security issues. To address the challenge of data security in MIoT, the integration of fog computing and MIoT is studied as an emerging and appropriate solution. By data security, it means that medial data is stored in fog nodes and transferred to the cloud in a secure manner to prevent any unauthorized access. In this paper, we propose a design for a secure fog-cloud based architecture for MIoT. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The rapid growth of the healthcare industry has been revolutionized by the emergence of medical sensors and mobile devices. These technological advances are part of the Internet of Things (IoT) where these devices are interconnected to exchange data to improve the delivery of various medical services including patient monitoring. Although IoT is considered a promising paradigm in healthcare, the security of patients' data is still a significant issue that should be thoroughly addressed. Access control is one of the main security mechanisms that should be applied to healthcare to limit access to patients' data to only authorized individuals. In this paper, we propose a distributed fog-based access control architecture for healthcare. In this design, the access control functions are distributed to bring policy decision and policy information mechanisms to the edges of the network near to the end nodes. This approach increases availability and decreases latency. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Improving the efficiency of healthcare systems is a top national interest worldwide. However, the need to deliver scalable healthcare services to patients while reducing costs is a challenging issue. Among the most promising approaches for enabling smart healthcare (s-health) are edge-computing capabilities and next-generation wireless networking technologies that can provide real-time and cost-effective patient remote monitoring. In this article, we present our vision of exploiting MEC for s-health applications. We envision a MEC-based architecture and discuss the benefits that it can bring to realize in-network and context-aware processing so that the s-health requirements are met. We then present two main functionalities that can be implemented leveraging such an architecture to provide efficient data delivery, namely, multimodal data compression and edge-based feature extraction for event detection. The former allows efficient and low distortion compression, while the latter ensures high-reliability and fast response in case of emergency applications. Finally, we discuss the main challenges and opportunities that edge computing could provide and possible directions for future research. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In the context of a fast aging population and of its increasing need for healthcare and assistance, ubiquitous usage of Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart applications can mitigate the consequential social burden. Connected sensors and devices inside the seniors' home produce a significant amount of data about them and their daily activities. IoT and Big Data Analytics (BDA) are an important mean to derive knowledge and support for improving the life conditions for the older adults by increasing the role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for accomplish this goal. IoT analytics can aid in personalizing applications that benefit both elderly people and the ever-growing industries that need adapt their offer to the consumer's profiles. This paper presents a new platform that enables innovative analytics on IoT captured data from smart residences of elderly people. A solution based on the use of fog nodes and cloud system is suggested in order to afford data-driven services and to manage the complexity and provision of the necessary resources for online and offline data processing, storage, and analysis. The requirements and the design of the platform architecture are underlined. We propose an architecture of a platform based on fog computing nodes coupled with cloud computing that offers an efficient near real time processing of the big data resulted from IoT system that provides insights and data processing and analysis facilities into cloud. This integrated design has an important impact on time sensitive applications by addressing the latency issues of cloud. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The global ageing population puts a burden on healthcare systems not only from the point of view of cost-related aspects, but also from the senior patients' point of view who tend to be predominately empowered regarding their own health management, digitally-skilled and demanding for personalized health protocols and solutions. Silver Digital Patients can be defined as seniors that master improved abilities of using digital technology in their daily activities, including in monitoring their health, who prove increased interest in having access to the best healthcare to preserve as much as possible their independence and health. An active, decent and safe life for seniors is at its best in their own homes; therefore, a remote health monitoring represents the most appropriate way to smooth the disruptive degenerative age-related factors, together with the important benefit of relieving the expenditures for senior institutionalizations. In this respect, emerging senior-centered technologies have the potential to provide a reliable support for building the most appropriate healthcare provision and environment. Internet of Health Things (IoHT) is a concept for a great variety of devices connected to the Internet that are able to gather a huge amount of diverse data-like health or environmental parameters-in order to keep a close remote watch on the patient, to improve the diagnose of his/her health status and to establish a better preventative healthcare. Edge computing brings the potential of improving the performance and responsiveness of IoHT by allowing the real-Time collected data to be pre-processed closer to the source, which can be extremely important for time-sensitive health data in order to identify and trigger anticipatory or reactive health actions. This paper presents a case study-' Non-invasive monitoring and health assessment of the elderly in a smart environment (RO-SmartAgeing)' project-That evaluates the opportunities brought by IoHT and edge computing for a monitoring application. The general objective of this project is to demonstrate the potential of some emerging technology for the positive transformation of how healthcare services are provided to the seniors and to healthcare provider. According to its current development state, a proposed IoHT-based architecture of the monitoring application and a data analytics demo for a health parameter is presented. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={With the rapid developments of wireless body area networks (WBANs), the main purpose of this emerging technology has been transformed from remote healthcare monitoring to resource-hungry interactive entertainment services such as AR/VR applications, which makes both WBANs and user equipment (UE) struggle to process the computation intensive and latency sensitive applications in real-time. This paper proposes a cooperative computation architecture that can handle the wireless big data applications by taking the advantages of WBANs and mobile edge computing (MEC). The access point (AP) in WBANs is integrated with remote radio head (RRH), which is capable of executing the high latency and low computation tasks, while MEC server can handle the low latency computation-intensive tasks. After introducing the proposed model, task classification, task offloading priority and AP offloading decision algorithms are given. Numerical results show that the proposed solution has significantly improved the network lifetime and the total number of successfully executed tasks, as compared with the existing relay-enabled task offloading scheme. Moreover, UEs with higher computation capacity promises a lower network average service latency. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The proliferation of inter-connected devices in critical industries, such as healthcare and power grid, is changing the perception of what constitutes critical infrastructure. The rising interconnectedness of new critical industries is driven by the growing demand for seamless access to information as the world becomes more mobile and connected and as the Internet of Things (IoT) grows. Critical industries are essential to the foundation of today’s society, and interruption of service in any of these sectors can reverberate through other sectors and even around the globe. In today’s hyper-connected world, the critical infrastructure is more vulnerable than ever to cyber threats, whether state sponsored, criminal groups or individuals. As the number of interconnected devices increases, the number of potential access points for hackers to disrupt critical infrastructure grows. This new attack surface emerges from fundamental changes in the critical infrastructure of organizations technology systems. This paper aims to improve understanding the challenges to secure future digital infrastructure while it is still evolving. After introducing the infrastructure generating big data, the functionality-based fog architecture is defined. In addition, a comprehensive review of security requirements in fog-enabled IoT systems is presented. Then, an in-depth analysis of the fog computing security challenges and big data privacy and trust concerns in relation to fog-enabled IoT are given. We also discuss blockchain as a key enabler to address many security related issues in IoT and consider closely the complementary interrelationships between blockchain and fog computing. In this context, this work formalizes the task of securing big data and its scope, provides a taxonomy to categories threats to fog-based IoT systems, presents a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art contributions in the field according to their security service and recommends promising research directions for future investigations. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={The diffusion of heterogeneous smart devices capable of capturing and analysing data about users, and/or the environment, has encouraged the growth of novel sensing methodologies. One of the most attractive scenarios in which such devices, such as smartphones, tablet computers, or activity trackers, can be exploited to infer relevant information is human activity recognition (HAR). Even though some simple HAR techniques can be directly implemented on mobile devices, in some cases, such as when complex activities need to be analysed timely, users' smart devices can operate as part of a more complex architecture. In this article, we propose a multi-device HAR framework that exploits the fog computing paradigm to move heavy computation from the sensing layer to intermediate devices and then to the cloud. As compared to traditional cloud-based solutions, this choice allows to overcome processing and storage limitations of wearable devices while also reducing the overall bandwidth consumption.

abstract={Healthcare has been highly benefited with the technology advancement. Technology-based new solutions, methods, applications, and systems completely revolutionize the healthcare industry. Earlier the decision making of doctor entirely depends on the experience, domain knowledge, laboratory reports, diagnostics and patient’s symptoms. With the advancement of technology in healthcare, the decision-making will be highly advanced and add wisdom to it. The patient’s care and regular monitoring have been vastly improved at low cost with the appearance of the Internet of things based healthcare systems. There are a lot of Internet of Things (IoT) based healthcare devices that produces enormous of data and transfer to the cloud for analysing and sharing with other stakeholders. Cloud computing is the backbone for such devices to collect, analyse and share the data or result with all the concern persons. Data are increasing day by day as the user base of IoT based healthcare devices has also been increased in folds. Due to such high volume of data, the latency rate, security issues and quality of analysed data has been decreased on the cloud. To overcome such limitation of cloud, a new paradigm called Fog computing has appeared. Fog computing is the intermediate layer between sensors and cloud servers. It facilitates the data gathering from various nearby sensors, analyses the data and provides the result to the sensor, cloud servers and other concerns locally. Deploying such computing infrastructure locally reduces the cost and increase the quality of analysis and alerting in real time. It also adds the security to the data as it is processed locally. This paper proposed an architecture to implement the fog computing between IoT sensors and cloud to handle the medical data. © 2019, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication.

abstract={VITASENIOR-MT is a telehealth platform that allows to remotely monitor biometric and environmental data in a domestic environment, designed specifically to the elderly population. This paper proposes a highly scalable and efficient architecture to transport, process, store and visualize the data collected by devices of an Internet of Things (IoT) scenario. The cloud infrastructure follows a microservices architecture to provide computational scalability, better fault isolation, easy integration and automatic deployment. This solution is complemented with a pre-processing and validation of the collected data at the edge of the Internet by using the Fog Computing concept, allowing a better computing distribution. The presented approach provides personal data security and a simplified way to collect and present the data to the different actors, allowing a dynamic and intuitive management of patients and equipment to caregivers. The presented load tests proved that this solution is more efficient than a monolithic approach, promoting better access and control in the data flowing from heterogeneous equipment. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Hypertension is a chronic disease causing risk of different types of disorders, such as hypertension attacks, cerebrovascular attacks, kidney failure, and cardiovascular diseases. To prevent such risks, statistics related to hypertension have to be monitored and analyzed in real-time. Internet of Things (IoT)-assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to monitor blood pressure (BP) and to diagnose the stage of hypertension in real-time. In this paper, IoT-fog-based healthcare system is proposed for continuous monitoring and analysis of BP statistics to predict hypertensive users. The proposed system initially identifies the stage of hypertension on the basis of user's health parameters collected using IoT sensors at fog layer. After identifying the hypertensive stage, artificial neural network is used for predicting the risk level of hypertension attack in users at remote sites. The vital point of this paper is to continuously generate emergency alerts of BP fluctuation from fog system to hypertensive users on their mobile phones. Finally, analysis results and compiled medical information of each user are stored on cloud storage for sharing with domain experts, such as clinicians, doctors, and personal caregivers. The temporal information generated from fog layer can be utilized for providing precautionary measures and suggestions well on time for patients' wellness. Experimental results reveal that proposed framework achieves low response time, high accuracy, and bandwidth efficiency. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Promoting smart and scalable remote health monitoring systems is challenging due to the enormous amount of collected data that needs to be processed and transferred given the limited network resources and battery-operated devices. Thus, the conventional cloud computing paradigm alone, is not always the most suitable solution for enabling such systems. In this context, we propose and implement a smart edge-based health system that aims at decreasing the system latency and energy consumption, while optimizing the delivery of the medical data. In particular, we formulate a multi-objective optimization framework that enables an edge node to dynamically adjust compression parameters and select the optimal radio access technology (RAT) while maintaining a trade-off between energy consumption, latency, and distortion. Furthermore, to evaluate and verify our framework, we develop an experimental testbed, where a data emulator is implemented to send EEG data to an edge node that classifies, compresses, and transfers the gathered data through the optimal RAT to the health cloud. Our experimental results show that the proposed system can offer about 30% energy savings while decreasing the delivery time to half of its value compared to a system that lacks edge processing capabilities. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) represents the most promising Internet of Things (IoT) application due to its relevance in the elders healthcare and improvement of their quality of life. Recently, the AAL IoT ecosystem has been enriched with promising technologies such as edge computing, which has demonstrated to be the best approach to overcome the demanding requirements of AAL and healthcare services by providing a reduction of the amount of data to transfer to the cloud, an improvement of the response time, and quality of experience. Also, the deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies at the edge provides intelligence to improve the decision making timely. However, this approach has been scarcely studied in AAL scenarios and the few proposals based on deploying machine learning models at the edge lack efficiency, security, mechanisms of resource management, service management, and deployment, as well as a real and experimental AAL scenario. For these reasons, this paper proposes an innovative edge gateway architecture to support the deployment of deep learning (DL) models in AAL and healthcare scenarios efficiently. To do so, we have added a predictive analytics module to deploy the models. Since AI technologies demand more resources, a container-based virtualization technology is employed on the edge gateway to manage the limited resources, and provide security and lifecycle services management. The edge gateway performance was evaluated deploying a DL-based fall detection application on it. As a result, our approach improves the inference time compared to that based on the cloud in 34 seconds and to similar approaches in 8 seconds. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The fast development of IoT in general and wearable smart sensors in particular in the context of wellness and healthcare are demanding for definition of specific infrastructure supporting real time data analysis for anomaly detection, event identification, situation awareness just to mention few. The explosion in the development and adoption of these smart wearable sensors has contributed to the definition of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), which is revolutionizing the way healthcare is tackled worldwide. Data produced by wearable sensors continuously grow and could be spread among clinical centers, hospitals, research labs, yielding to a Big Data management problem. In this paper we propose a technological and architectural solution, based on Open Source big data technologies to perform real-time analysis of wearable sensor data streams. The proposed architecture is composed of four distinct layers: a sensing layer, a pre-processing layer (Raspberry Pi), a cluster processing layer (Kafka's broker and Flink's mini-cluster) and a persistence layer (Cassandra database). A performance evaluation of each layer has been carried out by considering CPU and memory usage for accomplishing a simple anomaly detection task using the REALDISP dataset. © 2018},

abstract={Chikungunya is a mosquito instinctive disease that spreads hurriedly in various parts of the country. For the awareness and prevention measure of this disease a new paradigm in Smart Health (S-Health) required to be devised. The auspicious prospective of evolving Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for interconnected heterogeneous devices and objects has played a vital role in the next generation health care systems for eminent patient care to protect the citizens from these types of diseases. Still there is a need for real time health monitoring to analyze the patients for early preventive measures and precautions for healthy life. S-Health care IoT has substantial impending for the cognizance of analogues monitoring. It includes the interconnected apps, objects (devices and people), communication technologies, tracking system, and patients' knowledge base. This paper presents an IoT-enabled model where data collected from the sensors, objects, and people will be gathered at the cloud to take the preventive actions by healthcare professionals. Precautionary measures will be taken by collecting the information about causes of growth of mosquitoes. The suitability of the approach is validated at the base layer of the IoT and data is transmitted to the cloud with the help of edge nodes. From simulations, it is endorsed that the proposed approach is better over ME-CBCCP protocol. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The ongoing era of the Internet of Things is opening up new opportunities towards the integration and interoperation of heterogeneous technologies at different abstraction layers, going from the so-called Edge Computing up to the Cloud and IoT Data Analytics level. With this evolution process the issue of efficient remote reprogramming on the Edge and the Extreme Edge deployments is becoming accentuated, as the amount and diversity of embedded sensing platforms is getting larger. To take advantage of the participation of heterogeneous devices and their in-field dynamic collaboration, in this work a new distributed code dissemination strategy for Edge node reprogramming is proposed, so as to efficiently support the functional reconfiguration, optimization and updating of sensor devices. It combines a partial reprogramming engine integrated into a modular sensor node architecture, with a smart IoT wearable platform for implementing the field collaborative framework. Results show that the proposed solution outperforms other traditional centric dissemination strategies, particularly when expanding the network reprogramming diversity and scale, which is an increasingly common feature in the IoT device deployments and maintenance. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={We all know that many causalities have occurred (and are still occurring) due to the delay in medical relief arriving to emergencies. With the advent in technology and the communication tools available today, there isn't room for excuses in providing healthcare facilities at any place. The drone technology has now made it possible to send medical supplies to obscure and inaccessible places. Many researchers and systems have been provided to empower and enable more sophisticated services in the healthcare domain. Internet of Things (IoT) promises by way of many solutions and tools to deal with different situations. Our research in this article proposes an integrated framework to address the delay in response time for emergency cases in the E-health field. To combat the causes of delay in providing healthcare, our research advocates employing IoT objects and smart phone applications in addition to fog computing. The cooperation between the proposed mobile application and the proposed framework will create a comprehensive processing for this critical issue (Efficiency of First Aid System). © 2019 Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi.

abstract={Intelligent medical service system integrates wireless internet of things (WIoT), including medical sensors, wireless communications, and middleware techniques, so as to collect and analyze patients’ data to examine their physical conditions by many personal health devices (PHDs) in real time. However, large amount of malicious codes on the Android system can compromise consumers’ privacy, and further threat the hospital management or even the patients’ health. Furthermore, this sensor-rich system keeps generating large amounts of data and saturates the middleware system. To address these challenges, we propose a fog computing security and privacy protection solution. Specifically, first, we design the security and privacy protection framework based on the fog computing to improve tele-health and tele-medicine infrastructure. Then, we propose a context-based privacy leakage detection method based on the combination of dynamic and static information. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve higher detection accuracy and lower energy consumption compared with other state-of-art methods. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology that proffers to connect massive smart devices together and to the Internet. On the basis of IoT, a smart city is endowed with real-time monitoring, ubiquitous sensing, universal connectivity, and intelligent information processing and control. An IoT-based smart city can offer various smart services to citizens and administrators, thus improving the utilization of public resources regarding transportation, healthcare, environment, entertainment, and energy. The integration of transmitting, computing, and caching is having a profound impact on the development of flexible and efficient IoT in smart cities. However, with the introduction of ultra dense networking (UDN) and mobile edge computing (MEC), we have to carefully consider a joint problem across the physical layer and MAC layer to enable the efficient transmission, computation, and caching of big IoT data generated by massive IoT devices distributed in a city. In doing so, efficient multiple access and computation offloading should be addressed in the physical layer and MAC layer, respectively. In this article, we propose a scalable and sustainable IoT framework that integrates UDN-based hierarchical multiple access and computation offloading between MEC and cloud to support the smart city vision. The proposed integrated framework can substantially reduce the end-to-end delay and energy consumption of computing data from massive IoT devices. Numerical comparison results are presented to show the efficiency of the proposed framework. In addition, we discuss a number of open research issues in implementing the proposed framework. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={With the pervasive usage of IoT devices to collect healthcare data from human body, the real-time need on data acquirement and analysis for effective diagnosis and feedbacks becomes an challenging issue in practice. We propose a hybrid architecture, called EdgeCNN, that balances the capability of edge and cloud computing to address this issue for agile learning of healthcare data from IoT devices. Specifically, deep learning is customized as the inference method running on edge devices, making real-time analysis and diagnosis closer to the IoT data source. This can significantly reduce learning latency and network I/O, ease the pressure on the cloud platform for large user groups and massive data, and drastically decrease the cost to build and maintain cloud platforms. To verify the feasibility of EdgeCNN, we design a set of streamlined diagnosis model and learning algorithm for edge computing based on convolutional neural network (CNN), facilitating EdgeCNN to identify and infer electrocardiograms in real-time, as a specific healthcare application using smart devices on the edge. Our experimental results show that under the premise of ensuring the accuracy, EdgeCNN has significant advantages in diagnosis delay, network I/O, application usability and resource cost, in comparison with the architecture solely based on the cloud computing. Another important benefit from EdgeCNN is that it can effectively protect the privacy of user data from IoT devices. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In the Internet of Things (IoT) environments, cloud servers integrate various IoT devices including sensors and actuators, and provide new services that assist daily lives of users interacting with the physical world. While response time is a crucial factor of quality of the services, supporting short response time is challenging for the cloud servers due to a growing number and amount of connected devices and their communication. To reduce the burden of the cloud servers, fog computing is a promising alternative to offload computation and communication overheads from the cloud servers to fog nodes. However, since existing fog computing frameworks do not extract codes for fog nodes fully automatically, programmers should manually write and analyze their applications for fog computing. This work proposes Spinal Code, a new compiler-runtime framework for near-user computation that automatically partitions an original cloud-centric program into distributed sub-programs running over the cloud and fog nodes. Moreover, to reduce response time in the physical world, Spinal Code allows programmers to annotate latency sensitive actuators in a program, and optimizes the critical paths from required sensors to the actuators when it generates the sub-programs. This work implements 9 IoT programs across 4 service domains: healthcare, smart home, smart building and smart factory, and demonstrates that Spinal Code successfully reduces 44.3% of response time and 79.9% of communication on the cloud compared with a cloud-centric model. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={The Internet of healthcare things is essentially a new model that changes the way of the delivery and management of healthcare services. It utilizes digital sensors and cloud computing to present a quality healthcare service outside of the classical hospital environment. This resulted in the emergence of a new class of online web 4.0 services, which are termed “cloud healthcare services”. Cloud healthcare services offer a straightforward opportunity for patients to communicate with healthcare professionals and utilize their personal IoHT devices to obtain timely and accurate medical guidance and decisions. The personal IoHT devices integrate sensed health data at a central cloud healthcare service to extract useful health insights for wellness and preventive care strategies. However, the present practices for cloud healthcare services rely on a centralized approach, where patients’ health data are collected and stored on servers, located at remote locations, which might be functioning under data privacy laws somewhat different from the ones applied where the service is running. Promoting a privacy respecting cloud services encourages patients to actively participate in these healthcare services and to routinely provide an accurate and precious health data about themselves. With the emergence of fog computing paradigm, privacy protection can now be enforced at the edge of the patient’s network regardless of the location of service providers. In this paper, a framework for cloud healthcare recommender service is presented. We depicted the personal gateways at the patients’ side act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between IoHT devices and cloud healthcare services. A fog-based middleware will be hosted on these fog nodes for an efficient aggregation of patients generated health data while maintaining the privacy and the confidentiality of their health profiles. The proposed middleware executes a two-stage concealment process that utilizes the hierarchical nature of IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. At that, the patients will be empowered with a tool to control the privacy of their health data by enabling them to release their health data in a concealed form. The further processing at the cloud healthcare service continues over the concealed data by applying the proposed protocols. The proposed solution was integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the patients’ health data when utilized by a cloud healthcare recommender service to generate health insights. Our approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both patients and service providers. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

The academic and business communities are devoting many efforts to develop new applications that promote quality of life for this portion of the population; services, such as vital signs monitoring, fall detection systems, heart attacks, among others, are increasingly in evidence. Most of these e-health systems are focused on intelligent devices-Internet of Things (IoT). However, IoT by itself is not able to process, store and guarantee the quality of service of these services due to hardware capacity limitations. So, to mitigate this issue, IoT has two major allies in order to be able to provide e-health services with high availability and quality, fog and cloud computing. This paper presents in progress e-health architecture using IoT for data acquisition, fog for data pre-processing and short-Term storage, and cloud for data processing, analyze and long-Term storage. We also describe main challenges to provide an e-health application with high availability, high performance and accessibility, at low deployment and maintenance cost. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Health is a major aspect of life and determines the quality of life. In addition, healthy citizens are more productive and directly influence a country's economy. Thus, for citizens to not get deprived of primary care, it is important to have a proper health monitoring system. For creating such health monitoring system, making use of Internet of Things (IoT) can be the best solution. Fog computing services can be provided to IoT by creating local servers and making use of some computers. Various wireless connectivity solutions being developed have finally given IoT the ability to communicate with each other easily. One such connectivity solution is the Long Range (LoRa) radio which lets IoT communicate over long range with low energy consumption. In this paper, an architecture for smart health monitoring system is proposed and is implemented by creating a basic testbed. The system is an application of IoT deploying LoRa wireless communication under fog computing, benefitting the system with both the qualities of LoRa and fog computing. The test results show that the proposed system can be promising for changing the clinic-centric health system to smart patient-centric health system and for providing seamless health services to all. © 2017, © 2017 IETE.},

abstract={Fall detection is a major problem in the healthcare department. Elderly people are more prone to fall than others. There are more than 50% of injury-related hospitalizations in people aged over 65. Commercial fall detection devices are expensive and charge a monthly fee for their services. A more affordable and adaptable system is necessary for retirement homes and clinics to build a smart city powered by IoT and artificial intelligence. An effective fall detection system would detect a fall and send an alarm to the appropriate authorities. We propose a framework that uses edge computing where instead of sending data to the cloud, wearable devices send data to a nearby edge device like a laptop or mobile device for real-time analysis. We use cheap wearable sensor devices from MbientLab, an open source streaming engine called Apache Flink for streaming data analytics, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network model for fall classification. The model is trained using a published dataset called "MobiAct." Using the trained model, we analyse optimal sampling rates, sensor placement, and multistream data correction. Our edge computing framework can perform real-time streaming data analytics to detect falls with an accuracy of 95.8%. © 2019 Dharmitha Ajerla et al.},

abstract={Context: A fog computing architecture that is geographically distributed and to which a variety of heterogeneous devices are ubiquitously connected at the end of a network in order to provide collaboratively variable and flexible communication, computation, and storage services. Fog computing has many advantages and it is suited for the applications whereby real-time, high response time, and low latency are of the utmost importance, especially healthcare applications. Objectives: The aim of this study was to present a systematic literature review of the technologies for fog computing in the healthcare IoT systems field and analyze the previous. Providing motivation, limitations faced by researchers, and suggestions proposed to analysts for improving this essential research field. Methods: The investigations were systematically performed on fog computing in the healthcare field by all studies; furthermore, the four databases Web of Science (WoS), ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and Scopus from 2007 to 2017 were used to analyze their architecture, applications, and performance evaluation. Results: A total of 99 articles were selected on fog computing in healthcare applications with deferent methods and techniques depending on our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The taxonomy results were divided into three major classes; frameworks and models, systems (implemented or architecture), review and survey. Discussion: Fog computing is considered suitable for the applications that require real-time, low latency, and high response time, especially in healthcare applications. All these studies demonstrate that resource sharing provides low latency, better scalability, distributed processing, better security, fault tolerance, and privacy in order to present better fog infrastructure. Learned lessons: numerous lessons related to fog computing. Fog computing without a doubt decreased latency in contrast to cloud computing. Researchers show that simulation and experimental proportions ensure substantial reductions of latency is provided. Which it is very important for healthcare IoT systems due to real-time requirements. Conclusion: Research domains on fog computing in healthcare applications differ, yet they are equally important for the most parts. We conclude that this review will help accentuating research capabilities and consequently expanding and making extra research domains. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Smart bands are wearable devices that are frequently used in monitoring people’s activity, fitness, and health state. They can be also used in early detection of possibly dangerous health-related problems. The increasing number of wearable devices frequently transmitting data to scalable monitoring centers located in the Cloud may raise the Big Data challenge and cause network congestion. In this paper, we focus on the storage space consumed while monitoring people with smart IoT devices and performing classification of their health state and detecting possibly dangerous situations with the use of machine learning models in the Cloud and on the Edge. We also test two different repositories for storing sensor data in the Cloud monitoring center – a relational Azure SQL Database and the Cosmos DB document store. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={Healthcare Internet-of-things comprises a huge number of wearable sensors and interconnected computers. The high volume of IoT data is transacted over servers leading to servers overloading with high traffic causing network congestion. These cloud servers are typically for analyzing, retrieving and storing the large data generated from IoT devices. There exist challenges regarding sending real-time healthcare data from cloud servers to end-users. These challenges include the high computational latency, high communication latency, and high network latency. Due to these challenges, IoTs may not be able to send data in real-time to end-users. Fog nodes can be used to play a major role in reducing the high delay and high traffic. It can be a solution to increase system performance. In this paper, we proposed a 3-tier architecture, an analytical model for healthcare IoT using a hybrid approach consisting of fuzzy logic and reinforcement learning in a fog computing environment. The aim is to minimize network latency. The proposed model and 3-tier architecture are simulated using iFogSim simulator. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The new generation healthcare monitoring system combines technologies of wireless body sensor network, cloud computing, and Bigdata, and there are still limitations in protocol security, response delay, and prediction of potential severity disease. In response to the above situation, an Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)-based framework for fog-assisted healthcare monitoring is proposed. This framework is composite of body-sensing layer, fog layer, and cloud layer. The body-sensing layer generates physiological data, and fog computing node in fog layer collects and analyses time-sensitive data. Fog layer sends physiological data to cloud computing node in cloud layer for further processing. Mobile intelligent device connects fog computing node and helps individuals to predict the potential disease with its level of severity. The proposed framework uses advanced techniques such as IPv6-based network architecture, cloud–fog resource scheduling algorithm based on time threshold, and classification model of chronic diseases based on cascaded deep learning and so on. In order to determine the validity of the framework, health data were systematically generated from 45 patients for 30 days. Results depict that the proposed classification model of chronic diseases has high accuracy in determining the level of severity of potential disease.

abstract={The aging of the world’s population and the growth in the number of people with chronic diseases have increased expenses with medical care. Thus, the use of technological solutions has been widely adopted in the medical field to improve the patients’ health. In this context, approaches based on Cloud Computing have been used to store and process the information generated in these solutions. However, using Cloud can create delays that are intolerable for medical applications. Thus, the Fog Computing paradigm emerged as an alternative to overcome this problem, bringing computation and storage closer to the data sources. However, managing medical data stored in Fog is still a challenge. Moreover, characteristics of availability, performance, interoperability, and privacy need to be considered in approaches that aim to explore this problem. So, this article shows a software architecture based on Fog Computing and designed to facilitate the management of medical records. This architecture uses Blockchain concepts to provide the necessary privacy features and to allow Fog Nodes to carry out the authorization process in a distributed way. Finally, this paper describes a case study that evaluates the performance, privacy, and interoperability requirements of the proposed architecture in a home-centered healthcare scenario. © 2019 Cícero A.

abstract={The advancement of information technology in coming years will bring significant changes to the way healthcare data is processed. Technologies such as cloud computing, fog computing, and the Internet of things (IoT) will offer healthcare providers and consumers opportunities to obtain effective and efficient services via real-time data exchange. However, as with any computer system, these services are not without risks. There is the possibility that systems might be infiltrated by malicious users and, as a result, data could be corrupted, which is a cause for concern. Once an attacker damages a set of data items, the damage can spread through the database. When valid transactions read corrupted data, they can update other data items based on the value read. Given the sensitive nature of healthcare data and the critical need to provide real-time access for decision-making, it is vital that any damage done by a malicious transaction and spread by valid transactions must be corrected immediately and accurately. Here, we present two models for using fog computing in healthcare: an architecture using fog modules with heterogeneous data, and another using fog modules with homogeneous data. We propose a unique approach for each module to assess the damage caused by malicious transactions, so that original data may be recovered and affected transactions may be identified for future investigations. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={With the wide application of mobile healthcare systems, the total amount of healthcare data is ever increasing rapidly as users interact with healthcare service providers frequently. This leads to a challenging task to manage healthcare data. Existing work mainly pay attention to centralized and blockchain-based mechanisms. But they cannot adapt to the increasing amount of global healthcare data and suffer from complex application challenges, respectively. Decentralized and collaborative data management assisted by edge computing exhibits major advantages in improving overall system performance. We present a secure and efficient data management system named as EdgeCare for mobile healthcare systems. Local authorities are established to schedule edge servers for processing healthcare data and facilitating data trading. A hierarchical architecture with collaboration is designed for feasible implementation of EdgeCare. After that, we investigate secure data uploading and sharing in the system. We use an electronic medical record to show how healthcare data is processed with security considerations. We also conduct the Stackelberg game-based optimization algorithm to approach the optimal incentive mechanism for a data collector and users in the fair decentralized data trading. The numerical results with security analysis are provided to demonstrate that EdgeCare offers effective solutions to protect healthcare data, and support efficient data trading. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Latency is an important metric of mobile applications performance. To reduce the latency, recently it was proposed to replace the standard centralized architecture of mobile applications by the mobile edge computing (MEC). Such an approach allows processing of users data closer to their location. Motivated by disaster response scenarios, in this paper we investigated the capabilities of MEC for the forwarding of first aid request as an illustrative example of P2P service discovery in an emergency situation. We proposed an analytical model of the system and executed performance evaluation using system level simulator. Our results show that the developed solution considerably reduces the request processing time. The proposed solution can be used not only for first aid but also for general purposes, e.g., searching various service providers in a certain location. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The vast development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud-enabled data processing solutions provide the opportunity to build novel and fascinating smart, connected healthcare systems. Smart healthcare systems analyze the IoT-generated patient data to both enhance the quality of patient care and reduce healthcare costs. A major challenge for these systems is how the Cloud of Things can handle the data generated from billions of connected IoT devices. Edge computing infrastructure offers a promising solution by operating as a middle layer between the IoT devices and cloud computing. The Edge of Things (EoT) can offer small-scale real-time computing and storage capabilities that ensures low latency and optimal utilization of the IoT resources. However, the EoT has privacy-preservation issues, which is a significant concern for the healthcare systems that contain sensitive patient data. This paper introduces a novel EoT computing framework for secure and smart healthcare surveillance services. Fully homomorphic encryption preserves data privacy and is stored and processed within an EoT framework. A distributed approach for clustering-based techniques is developed for the proposed EoT framework with the scalability to aggregate and analyze the large-scale and heterogeneous data in the distributed EoT devices independently before it is sent to the cloud. We demonstrate the proposed framework by evaluating a case study for the patient biosignal data. Our framework rapidly accelerates the analysis response time and performance of the encrypted data processing while preserving a high level of analysis accuracy and data privacy. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) generate large data that is processed, analysed and filtered by cloud data centres. IoT is getting tremendously popular: the number of IoT devices worldwide is expected to reach 50.1 billion by 2020 and from this, 30.7% of IoT devices will be made available in Healthcare. Transmission and analysis of this much amount of data will increase the response time of cloud computing. The increase in response time will lead to high service latency to the end-users. The main requirement of IoT is to have low latency to transfer the data in real-time. Cloud cannot fulfill the QoS requirement in a satisfactory manner. Both the volume of data as well as factors related to internet connectivity may lead to high network latency in analyzing and acting upon the data. The propose research work introduces a hybrid approach that combines fuzzy and reinforcement learning to improve service and network latency in healthcare IoT and cloud. This hybrid approach integrates healthcare IoT devices with the cloud and uses fog services with Fuzzy Reinforcement Learning Data Packet Allocation (FRLDPA) algorithm. The propose algorithm performs batch workloads on IoT data to minimize latency and manages the QoS of the latency-critical workloads. It has the potential to automate the reasoning and decision making capability in fog computing nodes. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={Edge computing paradigm has attracted many interests in the last few years as a valid alternative to the standard cloud-based approaches to reduce the interaction timing and the huge amount of data coming from Internet of Things (IoT) devices toward the Internet. In the next future, Edge-based approaches will be essential to support time-dependent applications in the Industry 4.0 context; thus, the paper proposes BodyEdge, a novel architecture well suited for human-centric applications, in the context of the emerging healthcare industry. It consists of a tiny mobile client module and a performing edge gateway supporting multiradio and multitechnology communication to collect and locally process data coming from different scenarios; moreover, it also exploits the facilities made available from both private and public cloud platforms to guarantee a high flexibility, robustness, and adaptive service level. The advantages of the designed software platform have been evaluated in terms of reduced transmitted data and processing time through a real implementation on different hardware platforms. The conducted study also highlighted the network conditions (data load and processing delay) in which BodyEdge is a valid and inexpensive solution for healthcare application scenarios. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Edge-of-Things (EoT)-based healthcare services are forthcoming patient-care amenities related to autonomic and persuasive healthcare, where an EoT broker usually works as a middleman between the Healthcare Service Consumers (HSC) and Computing Service Providers (CSP). The computing service providers are the edge computing service providers (ECSP) and cloud computing service provider (CCSP). Sensor observations from a patient's body area networks (BAN) and patients’ medical and genetic historical data are very sensitive and have a high degree of interdependency. It follows that EoT based patient monitoring systems or applications are tightly coupled and require obstinate synchronization. Therefore, this paper proposes a portfolio optimization solution for the selection of virtual machines (VMs) of edge and/or cloud computing service providers. The dynamic pricing for an EoT computation service is considered by the EoT broker for optimal VM provisioning in an EoT environment. The proposed portfolio optimization solution is compared with the traditional certainty equivalent approach. As the portfolio optimization is a centralized solution approach, this paper also proposes an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based distributed provisioning method for the healthcare data in the EoT computing environment. A comparative study shows the cost-effective provisioning for the healthcare data through portfolio optimization and ADMM methods over the traditional certainty equivalent and greedy approach, respectively. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={The great challenges in the aging society and the lack of human resources, especially in health care, remains a formidable task. The cloud centric computing paradigm offers a solution in processing IoT applications in health care. However, due to the large computing and communication overheads, an alternative solution is sought. Here, we consider machine learning in edge computing to detect and improve the predictability accuracy in mobile health monitoring of human activity. With multi-modal sensor data, we conducted pre-processing to sanitize the data and classify the activities in the dataset. We used and compare the processing performance using random forests and SVM machine learning algorithms to identify and classify the activities in the dataset. We achieved approximately 99% accuracy with random forest which was better than SVM, at 98%. We used confusion matrix to identify the majority of mismatched data belonging to initial value of sensors while recording a particular activity, and also used visual representation of the data for better understanding. We extract the activity’s ECG data and classify into four categories to provide more specific information from the person’s activity data. The aforementioned experiments provided promising results and insights on the implementation to improve the prediction accuracy on the health status of people undergoing some activity. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the advent of IoT, cloud/fog based healthcare systems have become a growing trend in modern healthcare systems. These systems comprise of smart sensors, which on integration with medical devices, generate heterogeneous medical big data that can be used in diagnosis of various diseases. However, there is a continuous flow of large quantity of data in such a systems, due to which it may face many difficulties. Among various pre-requisites for proper functioning of these systems, lifetime is a vital factor. Keeping in view these aspects, the use of new hybrid whale-PSO algorithm (HWPSO) in clustering has been proposed for prolonging the network lifetime by preserving the power of network edge devices. In addition to this, a novel fitness function with a set of relevant criteria of edge devices such as energy factor, average intracluster distance, average distance to cluster leader over data analytics center, average sleeping time, and computational load has been taken into account in the selection of cluster leader. The cluster leader is responsible for managing intra-cluster and inter-cluster data communication. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper presents a structure of decision support system for pediatric cardiac disease, based on an Internet of Things (IoT) framework. The structure performs the intelligent decision making at its edge processing level, which classifies the heart sound signal, to three classes of cardiac conditions, normal, mild disease, and critical disease. Three types of the errors are introduced to evaluate the performance of the processing method, Type 1, 2 and 3, defined as the incorrect classification from the critical disease, mild, and normal, respectively. The method is validated using 140 real data patient records collected from the hospital referrals. The estimated negative errors for the Type 1, and 2, are calculated to be 0% and 4.8%, against the positive errors which are 6.3% and 13.3%, respectively. The Type 3, is calculated to be 16.7%, showing a high sensitivity of the method to be used in an IoT healthcare framework. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In an increasingly interconnected world, mobile and wearable devices, through short range communication interfaces and sensors, become needful tools for collecting and disseminating information in high population density environments. In this context Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS), leveraging people's roaming and their devices' resources, raised the citizen from mere walk-on parts to active participant in the knowledge building and data dissemination process. At the same time, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) architecture has recently enhanced the two-layer cloud-device architectural model easing the exchange of information and shifting most computational cost from devices towards middle-layer proxies, namely, network edges. We introduce Human-driven Edge Computing, a new model which melts together the power of MEC platform and the large-scale sensing of MCS to realize a better data spreading and environmental coverage in smart cities. In addition, it will be briefly discussed the main sociological aspects related to human behavior and how they can influence the exchange of data in large-scale sensor networks. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things has the potential of transforming health systems through the collection and analysis of patient physiological data via wearable devices and sensor networks. Such systems can offer assisted living services in real-time and offer a range of multimedia-based health services. However, service downtime, particularly in the case of emergencies, can lead to adverse outcomes and in the worst case, death. In this paper, we propose an e-health monitoring architecture based on sensors that relies on cloud and fog infrastructures to handle and store patient data. Furthermore, we propose stochastic models to analyze availability and performance of such systems including models to understand how failures across the Cloud-to-Thing continuum impact on e-health system availability and to identify potential bottlenecks. To feed our models with real data, we design and build a prototype and execute performance experiments. Our results identify that the sensors and fog devices are the components that have the most significant impact on the availability of the e-health monitoring system, as a whole, in the scenarios analyzed. Our findings suggest that in order to identify the best architecture to host the e-health monitoring system, there is a trade-off between performance and delays that must be resolved. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={The use of wearable and Internet-of-Things (IoT) for smart and affordable healthcare is trending. In traditional setups, the cloud backend receives the healthcare data and performs monitoring and prediction for diseases, diagnosis, and wellness prediction. Fog computing (FC) is a distributed computing paradigm that leverages low-power embedded processors in an intermediary node between the client layer and cloud layer. The diagnosis for wellness and fitness monitoring could be transferred to the fog layer from the cloud layer. Such a paradigm leads to a reduction in latency at an increased throughput. This paper processes a fog-based deep learning model, DeepFog that collects the data from individuals and predicts the wellness stats using a deep neural network model that can handle heterogeneous and multidimensional data. The three important abnormalities in wellness namely, (i) diabetes; (ii) hypertension attacks and (iii) stress type classification were chosen for experimental studies. We performed a detailed analysis of proposed models' accuracy on standard datasets. The results validated the efficacy of the proposed system and architecture for accurate monitoring of these critical wellness and fitness criteria. We used standard datasets and open source software tools for our experiments. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={The revolution in information technologies, and the spread of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart city industrial systems, have fostered widespread use of smart systems. As a complex, 24/7 service, healthcare requires efficient and reliable follow-up on daily operations, service and resources. Cloud and edge computing are essential for smart and efficient healthcare systems in smart cities. Emergency departments (ED) are real-time systems with complex dynamic behavior, and they require tailored techniques to model, simulate and optimize system resources and service flow. ED issues are mainly due to resource shortage and resource assignment efficiency. In this paper, we propose a resource preservation net (RPN) framework using Petri net, integrated with custom cloud and edge computing suitable for ED systems. The proposed framework is designed to model non-consumable resources and is theoretically described and validated. RPN is applicable to a real-life scenario where key performance indicators such as patient length of stay (LoS), resource utilization rate and average patient waiting time are modeled and optimized. As the system must be reliable, efficient and secure, the use of cloud and edge computing is critical. The proposed framework is simulated, which highlights significant improvements in LoS, resource utilization and patient waiting time. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a sweeping revolution in the healthcare industry, with IoT quickly establishing itself as a critical part of modern healthcare. The rapid proliferation of such IoMT devices can bring limitations to the current Cloud-IoT centric infrastructures which are not designed to handle huge volumes and velocity of data generated. To address this problem, it is necessary to revisit the network architecture, pushing some data, processing and services directly on the edge nodes of the network where the data originates, away from the centralized Cloud. In this context, Osmotic Computing (OC) aims to provide a new paradigm for the integration between a centralized Cloud layer and Edge/IoT layers. The deployment and migration strategies through the Cloud and Edge layers depend on the infrastructures and applications requirements. This scientific work promotes the basic principles behind the OC paradigm and proposes a closed-loop OC flow model applied to a gamified cognitive rehabilitation use case. Moreover, the use case introduces the development of a customized virtual reality system based on a serious game which allows the patient to carry out physical and cognitive rehabilitation therapies using a natural user interface based on Microsoft Kinect. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The disruptive vision of Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS) enables the promising next-generation of eHealth systems that are intended to interoperate efficiently, safely, and securely. Safety-critical interconnected systems that analyze patients' vital signs gathered from medical devices, infer the state of the patient's health, and start treatments issuing information to doctors and medical actuators should improve the patients' safety in a cost-efficient fashion. Despite the benefits provided by the MCPS vision, it also opens the door to critical challenges like the security and privacy, Quality of Service (QoS), and high availability of the devices composed to support the MCPS scenario. The Integrated Clinical Environment (ICE) standard is a significant step toward promoting open coordination of heterogeneous medical devices by considering the previous challenges. However, a lot of effort is still required in order to cover the whole aspects of these challenges and enable the future eHealth. In this context, we identify critical shortcomings of ICE using challenge scenarios regarding security, QoS, and high availability. According to these concerns and following the ICE standard, we propose the novel ICE++ architecture, which is oriented to the Mobile Edge Computing paradigm and combines SDN and NFV techniques to manage efficiently and automatically the MCPS elements taking into account its security, QoS, and high availability. Finally, we perform experiments that demonstrate the potential usefulness of our solution regarding the efficient and automatic management of the ICE components. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Internet of things provides interaction with billions of objects across the world using the Internet. In Internet of thing era, Healthcare Industry has grown-up from 1.0 to 4.0 generation. Healthcare 3.0 was hospital centric, where patients of long-lasting sickness suffered a lot due to multiple hospital visits for their routine checkups. This in turn, prolonged the treatment of such patients along with an increase in the overall expenditure on treatment of patients. However, with recent technological advancements such as fog and cloud computing, these problems are mitigated with a minimum capital investment on computing and storage facilities related to the data of the patients. Motivated from these facts, this paper provide an analysis of the role of fog computing, cloud computing, and Internet of things to provide uninterrupted context-aware services to the end users as and when required. We propose a three layer patient-driven Healthcare architecture for real-time data collection, processing and transmission. It gives insights to the end users for the applicability of fog devices and gateways in Healthcare 4.0 environment for current and future applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Cyber-Healthcare is an emerging field of the healthcare domain that builds upon cyber physical health systems (CPHSs) to provide pervasive access to medical services any time and from anywhere in the world where medical expertise is available. It is expected to change the way healthcare is delivered in the developing world and enable both its rural and urban settings to leapfrog from poorly equipped to medically prepared environments capable of tackling some of its most challenging health issues. However, owing to their infancy stage in the developing world, CPHSs require substantial research and practical work to move from their theoretical boundaries into the development, deployment and exploitation phase. This paper proposes a Cyber-Healthcare framework and its implementation as a fog-based CPHS infrastructure using low-cost lightweight devices to achieve patients’ condition recognition as a first step towards the implementation of digital healthcare support systems in the developing world. We propose a multi-layer architecture for the framework and consider a patients’ condition recognition system that uses machine learning techniques as a key component of the framework. We present experimental results that reveal i) the relative efficiency of different machine learning algorithms used for patient condition recognition and ii) the storage and processing overheads incurred by two popular lightweight embedded devices when used as fog computing devices in the CPHS. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Typical real-time remote health monitoring architectures consist of wearable medical devices continuously transmitting physiological signals to a nearby gateway which routes the data to an remote internet of things (IoT)-platform. Unfortunately, this model falls-short under the strict requirements of healthcare systems. Wearable medical devices have short battery lifespans, the system reliance on a cloud makes it vulnerable to connectivity and latency issues, and there are privacy concerns related to streaming sensitive medical data to remote servers. The compressive sensing (CS) scheme has been explored in the context of bio-signals to reduce the energy consumption of wearable sensors. However, CS does not address the other limitations caused by the model's reliance on cloud-computing but exacerbates the associated computing latency by requiring a computationally complex reconstruction process. In our remote elderly monitoring system, we attempt to address this weakness by developing a gateway-centric connected health system, where most signal processing and analysis occurs locally on heterogeneous multicore edge-devices. This paper explores the efficacy of real-time reconstruction of ECG signals, compressed under the CS scheme, on an IoT-gateway powered by ARM's big. LITTLE multicore solution at different signal dimension and allocated computational resources. Experimental results show the gateway's capability to reconstruct ECG signals in real-time, even when considering dimensionally large windows and minimum computational resources. Moreover, they demonstrate that utilizing more cores for the reconstruction process has a higher impact on execution time and is more energy efficient than increasing the cores' frequency. The optimal resource allocation for the majority of cases is a single big (A15) core at minimum frequency as it provides extreme fast reconstruction while consuming less or slightly more energy than its LITTLE (A7) counterpart. Heterogeneous multicore devices have the computational capacity and energy efficiency to elevate some of the limitations of a cloud-based remote health monitoring and can help create a more sustainable IoT-based connected health. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) will transform the healthcare industry, and enable the emergence of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). In this paper, we present and analyze HERMIT, a benchmark suite for the IoMT. The goal of HERMIT is to facilitate research into new microarchitectures and optimizations that will enable efficient execution of emerging IoMT applications. HERMIT comprises of applications spanning various domains in the healthcare industry, including computerized tomography scan, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, implantable heart monitors, wearable devices. HERMIT also includes supplementary applications for security and data compression. We analyze HERMIT on an IoT prototyping platform to derive insights into IoMT applications' compute and memory characteristics. We also compare HERMIT to three commonly used benchmark suites: 1) MiBench; 2) SPEC CPU2006; and 3) PARSEC, and show that IoMT applications' characteristics differ from existing benchmarks. Our results motivate the need for a new benchmark suite to enable IoMT-Targeted microarchitecture research. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Reducing energy consumption in the fog computing environment is both a research and an operational challenge for the current research community and industry. There are several industries such as finance industry or healthcare industry that require a rich resource platform to process big data along with edge computing in fog architecture. As a result, sustainable computing in a fog server plays a key role in fog computing hierarchy. The energy consumption in fog servers depends on the allocation techniques of services (user requests) to a set of virtual machines (VMs). This service request allocation in a fog computing environment is a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard problem. In this paper, the scheduling of service requests to VMs is presented as a bi-objective minimization problem, where a tradeoff is maintained between the energy consumption and makespan. Specifically, this paper proposes a metaheuristic-based service allocation framework using three metaheuristic techniques, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), binary PSO, and bat algorithm. These proposed techniques allow us to deal with the heterogeneity of resources in the fog computing environment. This paper has validated the performance of these metaheuristic-based service allocation algorithms by conducting a set of rigorous evaluations. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The digital world is expanding rapidly and advances in networking technologies such as 4G long-term evolution (LTE), wireless broadband (WiBro), low-power wide area networks (LPWAN), 5G, LiFi, and so on, all of which are paving the way for the emergence of sophisticated services. The number of online applications is increasing along with more computation, communication, and intelligent capabilities. Although current devices in use today are also getting more powerful in terms of features and capabilities, but they are still incapable of executing smart, autonomous, and intelligent tasks such as those often required for smart healthcare, ambient assisted living (AAL), virtual reality, augmented reality, intelligent vehicular communication, as well as in many services related to smart cities, Internet of Things (IoT), Tactile Internet, Internet of Vehicles (IoV), and so on. For many of these applications, we need another entity to execute tasks on behalf of the user's device and return the results - a technique often called offloading, where tasks are outsourced and the involved entities work in tandem to achieve the ultimate goal of the application. Task offloading is attractive for emerging IoT and cloud computing applications. It can occur between IoT nodes, sensors, edge devices, or fog nodes. Offloading can be performed based on different factors that include computational requirements of an application, load balancing, energy management, latency management, and so on. We present a taxonomy of recent offloading schemes that have been proposed for domains such as fog, cloud computing, and IoT. We also discuss the middleware technologies that enable offloading in a cloud-IoT cases and the factors that are important for offloading in a particular scenario. We also present research opportunities concerning offloading in fog and edge computing. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) is a life-threatening tick-borne viral infectious disease endemic to South Asia and has been taking so many lives every year in the past decade. But recently, this disease has been witnessed in other regions to a large extent and can become an epidemic very soon. In this paper, a new fog computing based e-Healthcare framework has been proposed to monitor the KFD infected patients in an early phase of infection and control the disease outbreak. For ensuring high prediction rate, a novel Extremal Optimization tuned Neural Network (EO-NN) classification algorithm has been developed using hybridization of the extremal optimization with the feed-forward neural network. Additionally, a location based alert system has also been suggested to provide the global positioning system (GPS)-based location information of each KFD infected user and the risk-prone zones as early as possible to prevent the outbreak. Furthermore, a comparative study of proposed EO-NN with state of art classification algorithms has been carried out and it can be concluded that EO-NN outperforms others with an average accuracy of 91.56%, a sensitivity of 91.53% and a specificity of 97.13% respectively in classification and accurate identification of risk-prone areas. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The use of Information and Communications Technology (ICTs) in healthcare has the potential of minimizing medical errors, reducing healthcare cost and improving collaboration between healthcare systems which can dramatically improve the healthcare service quality. However interoperability within different healthcare systems (clinics/hospitals/pharmacies) remains an issue of further research due to a lack of collaboration and exchange of healthcare information. To solve this problem, cross healthcare system collaboration is required. This paper proposes a conceptual semantic based healthcare collaboration framework based on Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure that is able to offer a secure cross system information and knowledge exchange between different healthcare systems seamlessly that is readable by both machines and humans. In the proposed framework, an intelligent semantic gateway is introduced where a web application with restful Application Programming Interface (API) is used to expose the healthcare information of each system for collaboration. A case study that exposed the patient's data between two different healthcare systems was practically demonstrated where a pharmacist can access the patient's electronic prescription from the clinic. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={As wearable devices become more ingrained in our daily lives, traditional communication networks primarily designed for human-being-oriented applications are facing tremendous challenges. The forthcoming fifth-generation (5G) wireless systems look to support unprecedented high capacity, low latency, and massive connectivity. In this article, we examine key challenges facing wearable communication devices. A cloud/edge communication architecture that integrates the cloud radio access network (CRAN), software-defined network (SDN), device-To-device (D2D) communications, and cloud/edge technologies is presented. Computation offloading enabled by this multilayer communications architecture can offload computation-excessive and latency-stringent applications to nearby devices through D2D communications or to nearby edge nodes through cellular or other wireless technologies. Critical issues faced by wearable communications, e.g., short battery life, limited computing capability, and stringent latency, can be greatly alleviated by this cloud/edge architecture. Together with the presented architecture, current transmission and networking technologies [including nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA), mobile edge computing (MCE), and energy harvesting] can greatly enhance the performance of wearable communications in terms of spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, latency, and connectivity. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Over the last years, solutions based on Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) have opted for the deployment of eHealth services to provide a higher level of quality and safety to medical processes, with which to mitigate human errors. As a result, Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS) is a new disruptive approach oriented to enable smart healthcare systems to monitor, process and make autonomous decisions without the need to involve doctors and caregivers. Yet, current MCPS pose several open challenges, the security of medical devices being one of the most critical ones because of its close relationship with patients’ safety. To deal with these issues, mobile edge cloud computing – or fog computing – can be used to improve the security of MCPS by enabling the deployment and management of efficient resources into the network edge. In this context, we propose the novel concept of Virtual Medical Device as a sustainable and efficient mechanism deployed in the network edge to ease and provide dynamism and low latency for achieving security in MCPS. Additionally, we also propose a fog computing-oriented framework to enable real-time and dynamic management of physical and virtual medical devices as well as network infrastructure composing MCPS. To show our solution feasibility, we designed a reactive and proactive use case depicting security concerns of current MCPS. We also describe how our framework arranges MCPS with management policies that consider patients’ vital signs, network communications, and location of medical devices and patients. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Now we are entering the era of the Internet of Everything (IoE) and billions of sensors and actuators are connected to the network. As one of the most sophisticated IoE applications, real-time video analytics is promising to significantly improve public safety, business intelligence, and healthcare & life science, among others. However, cloud-centric video analytics requires that all video data must be preloaded to a centralized cluster or the cloud, which suffers from high response latency and high cost of data transmission, given the scale of zettabytes of video data generated by IoE devices. Moreover, video data is rarely shared among multiple stakeholders due to various concerns, which restricts the practical deployment of video analytics that takes advantages of many data sources to make smart decisions. Furthermore, there is no efficient programming interface for developers and users to easily program and deploy IoE applications across geographically distributed computation resources. In this paper, we present a new computing framework, Firework, which facilitates distributed data processing and sharing for IoE applications via a virtual shared data view and service composition. We designed an easy-to-use programming interface for Firework to allow developers to program on Firework. This paper describes the system design, implementation, and programming interface of Firework. The experimental results of a video analytics application demonstrate that Firework reduces up to 19.52 percent of response latency and at least 72.77 percent of network bandwidth cost, compared to a cloud-centric solution. © 1990-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Inspired by the recent developments of the Internet of Things (IoT) relay and mobile edge computing (MEC), a hospital/home-based medical monitoring framework is proposed, in which the intensive computing tasks from the implanted sensors can be efficiently executed by on-body wearable devices or a coordinator-based MEC (C-MEC). In this paper, we first propose a wireless relay-enabled task offloading mechanism that consists of a network model and a computation model. Moreover, to manage the computation resources among all relays, a task offloading decision model and the best task offloading recipient selection function is given. The performance evaluation considers different computation schemes under the predetermined link quality condition regarding the selected vital quality of service (QoS) metrics. After demonstrating the channel characterization and network topology, the performance evaluation is implemented under different scenarios regarding the network lifetime of all relays, network residual energy status, total number of locally executed packets, path loss (PL), and service delay. The results show that data transmission without the offloading scheme outperforms the offload-based technique regarding network lifetime. Moreover, the high computation capacity scenario achieves better performance regarding PL and the total number of locally executed packets. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={With the proliferation of the Internet of Things (loT) and cloud based services, it becomes very essential to design and implement efficient mechanisms, to protect the users private information and secure them, taking into account the loT devices limited computational and storage capabilities. In addition, these devices are usually accessed by multiple users, and are connected to a cloud service provider, that have an access of the users data. In this paper, a privacy preserving framework is proposed that utilizes Fog layer, which act as intermediator between the loT devices and the cloud, where users data are anonymized and secured. Further, a case study in the field of healthcare is described that shows the importance of the proposed framework. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The continuous adoption of fitness and medical smart sensors are boosting the development of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), reshaping and revolutionizing Healthcare. This digital transformation is paving the way to new forms of care based on real-time analysis of huge amounts of data produced by sensors, which is seen as a basis for improving clinical efficiency and helping to save lives. A medical sensor typically produces several KBs of data per second so the collection and analysis of these data can be approached with Big Data technologies. The aim of this paper is to present and evaluate a hybrid architecture for real-time anomaly detection from data streams coming from sensors attached to patients. The architecture includes an edge computing data staging platform based on Raspberry Pi 3 for data logging, data transformation in RDF triple and data streaming towards a cluster computing running Apache Kafka for collecting RDFStreams, Apache Flink for running a parallel version of the Hierarchical Temporal Memory algorithm and Cassandra for data storing. The different layers of the architecture have been evaluated in terms of both CPU performance and memory usage using the REALDISP dataset. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The increase in the growth of healthcare IoT devices leads to a large volume and variety of healthcare data. The large healthcare data generates high data traffic that will cause network bottleneck and burdens the cloud with an extra amount of workload. The main requirement of healthcare IoT is to have a minimum network and service latency along with conserve network bandwidth. Both the volume of data as well as factors related to internet connectivity may lead to high network latency in analyzing and acting upon device data. Therefore, due to high network latency, high service latency and large data transmission from IoT devices, the cloud is unable to send the patient health data in real-Time mode. Fog computing is a new approach to address this requirement of cloud and healthcare IoT devices. A tentative novel solution for the above-mentioned problem using fuzzy-based fog computing architecture that integrates healthcare IoT devices with the cloud and uses fog services with Fuzzy Data Packet Allocation (FDPA) algorithm. Using virtualization and fuzzy inference system (FIS) in fog computing, the proposed algorithm is expected to transfer the patient health data in real-Time mode to agencies and doctors. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Blockchain, as the backbone technology of the current popular Bitcoin digital currency, has become a promising decentralized data management framework. Although blockchain has been widely adopted in many applications (e.g., finance, healthcare, and logistics), its application in mobile services is still limited. This is due to the fact that blockchain users need to solve preset proof-of-work puzzles to add new data (i.e., a block) to the blockchain. Solving the proof of work, however, consumes substantial resources in terms of CPU time and energy, which is not suitable for resource-limited mobile devices. To facilitate blockchain applications in future mobile Internet of Things systems, multiple access mobile edge computing appears to be an auspicious solution to solve the proof-of-work puzzles for mobile users.

abstract={The recent development of big data-oriented wireless technologies in terms of emerging 5G, edge computing, interconnected devices of the Internet of Things (IoT), and data analytics, as well as techniques, have enabled connected healthcare services for a happier and healthier life. Although, the quality of the healthcare services can be enhanced through big data-oriented wireless technologies, however, the challenges remain for not considering emotional care, especially for children, elderly, and mentally ill people. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware connected healthcare system using a powerful emotion detection module. Different IoT devices are used to capture speech and image signals of a patient in a smart home scenario. These signals are used as the input to the emotion detection module. Speech and image signals are processed separately, and classification scores using these signals are fused to produce a final score to take a decision about the emotion. If the emotion is detected as pain, caregivers can visit the patient. Several experiments were performed to validate the proposed system, and good accuracies, up to 99.87%, were achieved for emotion detection. The proposed framework would greatly contribute personalized and seamless emotion-aware healthcare services toward 5G. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, an accelerating number of studies are dedicated to deploying various IoT applications in the information centric network paradigm which has lower system complexity than traditional network architectures. However, such a paradigm poses a number of security challenges especially when it is applied in real-time e-health applications. Firstly, it is difficult to ensure security of sensitive data in such a distributed data caching environment because after the data is published in the form of a packet to the information centric network (ICN), it is no longer controlled by the data publisher. Secondly, in some real-time e-health applications, terminal medical sensors are usually resource-constrained, limiting the direct adoption of expensive cryptographic primitives. In order to address these challenges, a resource-efficient secure data sharing scheme in information centric e-health system is proposed, one that utilizes ciphertext-policy attribute based encryption (CP-ABE) and adapts it to the above-mentioned system with respect to necessary security requirements. It also exploits computation resources of fog nodes and employs outsourcing cryptography to improve system efficiency.The evaluation demonstrates that the scheme can significantly reduce the computation overheads of the resource-constrained terminal medical devices, and can better support the real-time e-health applications. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The feasibility and popularity of mobile healthcare are currently increasing. The advancement of modern technologies, such as wireless communication, data processing, the Internet of Things, cloud, and edge computing, makes mobile healthcare simpler than before. In addition, the deep learning approach brings a revolution in the machine learning domain. In this paper, we investigate a voice pathology detection system using deep learning on the mobile healthcare framework. A mobile multimedia healthcare framework is also designed. In the voice pathology detection system, voices are captured using smart mobile devices. Voice signals are processed before being fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN). We use a transfer learning technique to use the existing robust CNN models. In particular, the VGG-16 and CaffeNet models are investigated in the paper. The Saarbrucken voice disorder database is used in the experiments. Experimental results show that the voice pathology detection accuracy reaches up to 97.5% using the transfer learning of CNN models. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={A smart city has recently become an aspiration for many cities around the world. These cities are looking to apply the smart city concept to improve sustainability, quality of life for residents, and economic development. The smart city concept depends on employing a wide range of advanced technologies to improve the performance of various services and activities such as transportation, energy, healthcare, and education, while at the same time improve the city's resources utilization and initiate new business opportunities. One of the promising technologies to support such efforts is the big data technology. Effective and intelligent use of big data accumulated over time in various sectors can offer many advantages to enhance decision making in smart cities. In this paper we identify the different types of decision making processes involved in smart cities. Then we propose a service-oriented architecture to support big data analytics for decision making in smart cities. This architecture allows for integrating different technologies such as fog and cloud computing to support different types of analytics and decision-making operations needed to effectively utilize available big data. It provides different functions and capabilities to use big data and provide smart capabilities as services that the architecture supports. As a result, different big data applications will be able to access and use these services for varying proposes within the smart city. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a scheme, criticality-aware data transmission (CARE) in CPS-based healthcare systems, for increasing the processing rate of the sensed physiological parameters' value of any patient. The criticality of a patient may vary at any instant of time, and thus, continuous monitoring and quick processing of the physiological parameter value of a patient is essential. Therefore, in order to reduce the latency of data processing of a critical patient, we consider fog computing in our architecture. Based on the criticality value of physiological parameters, a Local Processing Unit (LPU) transmits the sensor data either to the fog aggregation node or cloud. We use a cooperative game theory-based Nash bargaining approach, where the LPUs bargain among themselves to decide whether the sensor data need to be transmitted to cloud or fog aggregation node. Based on the criticality index and the weight factor assigned to the LPU participating in the bargaining process, the utility of each LPU is computed. Analytical results show that the utility increases with the increase in the criticality index of any patient. Considering the total number of WBANs 5, 10, and 15, the average utility varies 75%-80%. Moreover, the data dissemination delay and power consumption are reduced by 23.39% and 31.089% respectively in the presence of fog node. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={With the rapid development of sensing and communication capacities, wearable technology, one of the most significant trends in the mobile computing evolution, has been changing our daily life. Wearable devices generally require a powerful local hub to replenish computing capacities for advanced features. However, it is inconvenient to carry the local hub in many situations, even though more and more wearable devices are equipped with a WiFi/cellular interface, enabling them to exchange data with the local hub through the Internet, However, this results in long response time and functional limitations. To overcome the restriction of a physical local hub, we propose a VLH solution, which utilizes network equipment nearby (e.g., a WiFi hotspot or cellular base station) as the local hub. In this article, we first describe the operating mechanism of a local hub and give an overview of the VLH system. Then we describe the system design of the VLH, including the container-based virtualization and the modified microservice architecture which enables remote function module sharing in the fog-computing environment. We then propose an algorithm to deal with function module allocation and sharing decisions. Finally, we demonstrate and verify the effectiveness and practicality of VLH via both simulations under large-scale network setting and real-world prototype implementation. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper introduces an edge-computing based Complex Event Processing (CEP) architecture for Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) which is an important issue in the context of remote healthcare. In this architecture, the detection of complex events, that may indicate impending health problems, is performed on a mobile device that receives data from sensors attached to the body of a patient. The detected complex events are sent to a back-end hospital server running on a cloud for further processing. Current state-of-The-Art RPM techniques use the mobile device as an IoT gateway agent to forward data streams from health sensors to a remote hospital server where complex events are detected. A drawback of this existing methodology is that the mobile phone always needs to remain connected to the hospital server. Also, the mobile network consumption is increased while transferring large volumes of sensor data streams thus leading to an increase in the user cost. Additionally, it leads to an increase in the workload at the hospital server that serves multiple patients. This research investigates a mobile device based CEP system for addressing these issues and demonstrates its viability through a proof-of-concept prototype. A thorough performance analysis is performed using a synthetic workload that provides insights into system scalability and the relationship between system/workload parameters and performance. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={As we are within the era of the internet of things (IoT) its increasing integration to our everyday lives means that the devices involved produce massive amounts of data every second from billions of devices. The current approach used to handle this data is cloud computing. However because of its requirement of data centres this can become infeasible for the processing of data from IoT due to distance between these IoT smart objects (e.g., sensors) and the data centre. If this data holds any importance to minimal delay then the travel time between the end device and the clouds data centre could affect the relevance of that data. Therefore, to deal with these issues a new network paradigm placed closer to the IoT end devices is introduced called "Fog computing" to help address these challenges. If introduced effectively then fog computing can lead to the improvements in the quality of service (QoS) offered to systems that require the processing of delay sensitive data like healthcare systems that could benefit from the quick processing of data from sensors to allow the monitoring of patients. This paper has a main focus on healthcare systems. An architecture containing three layers; things (i.e., sensors), fog nodes and a cloud data centre is proposed alongside a framework incorporating this architecture. This framework offers collaboration among fog nodes with optimal management of resources and job allocation, which is able to achieve a high QoS (i.e., low latency) within the scenario of a healthcare system. © 2018 ACM.},

abstract={Obtrusive sleep apnea (OSA) is one of the most important sleep disorders because it has a direct adverse impact on the quality of life. Intellectual deterioration, decreased psychomotor performance, behavior, and personality disorders are some of the consequences of OSA. Therefore, a real-time monitoring of this disorder is a critical need in healthcare solutions. There are several systems for OSA detection. Nevertheless, despite their promising results, these systems not guiding their treatment. For these reasons, this research presents an innovative system for both to detect and support of treatment of OSA of elderly people by monitoring multiple factors such as sleep environment, sleep status, physical activities, and physiological parameters as well as the use of open data available in smart cities. Our system architecture performs two types of processing. On the one hand, a pre-processing based on rules that enables the sending of real-time notifications to responsible for the care of elderly, in the event of an emergency situation. This pre-processing is essentially based on a fog computing approach implemented in a smart device operating at the edge of the network that additionally offers advanced interoperability services: technical, syntactic, and semantic. On the other hand, a batch data processing that enables a descriptive analysis that statistically details the behavior of the data and a predictive analysis for the development of services, such as predicting the least polluted place to perform outdoor activities. This processing uses big data tools on cloud computing. The performed experiments show a 93.3% of effectivity in the air quality index prediction to guide the OSA treatment. The system's performance has been evaluated in terms of latency. The achieved results clearly demonstrate that the pre-processing of data at the edge of the network improves the efficiency of the system. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper has proposed a Fog architecture-based framework, which classifies dengue patients into uninfected, infected and severely infected using a data set built in 2010. The aim of this proposed framework is to developed a latency-aware system for classifying users into different categories based on their respective symptoms using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and audio and video files. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the aforesaid aim, a smart framework is proposed, which consist of three components, namely, IoT layer, Fog infrastructure and cloud computing. The latency of the system is reduced by using network devices located in the Fog infrastructure. Data generated by IoT layer will first be processed by Fog layer devices which are in closer proximity of the user. Raw data and data generated will later be stored on cloud infrastructure, from where it will be sent to different entities such as user, hospital, doctor and government healthcare agencies. Findings: Experimental evaluation proved the hypothesis that using the Fog infrastructure can achieve better response time for latency sensitive applications with the least effect on accuracy of the system. Originality/value: The proposed Fog-based architecture can be used with IoT to directly link it with the Fog layer. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In the past decade, the revolution in miniaturization (microprocessors, batteries, cameras etc.) and manufacturing of new type of sensors resulted in a new regime of applications based on smart objects called IoT. Majority of such applications or services are to ease human life and/or to setup efficient processes in automated environments. However, this convenience is coming up with new challenges related to data security and human privacy. The objects in IoT are resource constrained devices and cannot implement a fool-proof security framework. These end devices work like eyes and ears to interact with the physical world and collect data for analytics to make expedient decisions. The storage and analysis of the collected data is done remotely using cloud computing. The transfer of data from IoT to the computing clouds can introduce privacy issues and network delays. Some applications need a real-Time decision and cannot tolerate the delays and jitters in the network. Here, edge computing or fog computing plays its role to settle down the mentioned issues by providing cloud-like facilities near the end devices. In this paper, we discuss IoT, fog computing, the relationship between IoT and fog computing, their security issues and solutions by different researchers. We summarize attack surface related to each layer of this paradigm which will help to propose new security solutions to escalate it acceptability among end users. We also propose a risk-based trust management model for smart healthcare environment to cope with security and privacy-related issues in this highly un-predictable heterogeneous ecosystem. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Mobile, IoT, and wearable devices have been transitioning from passive consumers of remote data to active generators of massive amounts of data. Mobile apps often need to move data, generated on one device, to other nearby devices for processing. For example, when reading its wearer's health vitals, a health monitoring app on a wearable device needs to transfer the data to the wearer's smartphone for display and analysis. This local processing of data by means of nearby computing resources has been promoted as a solution to network bandwidth bottlenecks, and commonly referred to as edge computing. Despite the critical dependence of edge computing on the device-to-device data sharing functionality, its mainstream implementations introduce low-level and hard-to-maintain code into the mobile codebase. To address this problem, this research introduces Remote ICC (RICCi), a novel middleware framework that provides programming support for data-intensive mobile applications at the edge, thereby reconciling programming convenience and performance efficiency. RICCi builds upon the native Android Inter-Component Communication (ICC) to simultaneously support seamless and efficient inter-device data sharing via a convenient and familiar programming model. To reach these design objectives, RICCi innovates in the middleware space by offering distributed programming abstractions that are data-oriented rather than procedure-oriented, thereby elevating latency into a first-class design concern for developing distributed mobile apps. © 2018 ACM.},

abstract={In today's era health informatics is a major contributor to the advancements in ubiquitous computing. Of late, the concept of mobile health (mHealth) systems has attracted considerable attention from both medical computer science communities. mHealth devices generate a significant amount of patient data on a timely basis. This data is often stored on cloud-based EHR and PHR systems to aid in timely and better quality healthcare service. However, as has been seen lately, stored personal records act as honeypots for malicious entities and the internet underground. It is thus imperative to prevent unauthorized leakage of mHealth data from cloud-based E/PHR systems. As observed from some of our preliminary research, NIST's policy machine (PM) framework suits the access control modeling requirements posed by mHealth systems. Moreover, the graph-based model adopted by this framework allows efficient policy management through advanced graph search techniques. In this paper, we leverage the policy machine model to propose a cloud-based service that achieves secure storage and fine-grained dissemination of mHealth data. The primary goal of this work is to demonstrate the applicability of the PM framework to the mHealth domain and illustrate the workflow of an algorithm to resolve access decisions in theoretically faster time than achieved by existing implementations. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={There is a significant improvement in the healthcare services recently due to the integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). There are new service models in Healthcare systems being developed and used nowadays influenced by the use different technologies. Cloud computing and Mobile computing technologies are playing a major role in this transfer. Physicians can use their smart mobile devices to run useful medical applications, access patients records, and place lab orders. However, mobile devices limitations including battery lifetime and processing capabilities prevent the ultimate use of these devices. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) can resolve many mobile computing limitations. However, MCC has its challenges including high latency and large transmission power consumption when accessing compute and storage resources over the network. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and requirements of a converged mobile healthcare cloud infrastructure for Saudi Arabia. This study aims to identify the requirements for cloud infrastructures that will be needed in the kingdom to support integrated countrywide interoperable healthcare applications and systems. In the future, we are planning to propose designs of network and system architectures for next generation mobile cloud-based healthcare system in Saudi Arabia. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Millions of people suffer from some way of sleep disorder. As a result, their quality of sleep decreases dramatically affecting not only their sleep but also the quality of their day to day life. Waiting lists for receiving a professional diagnose can be very long leaving the patient unable to take precautions to improve their sleep quality. In this paper, we propose an IoT-based sleep quality monitoring pillow that tracks temperature, humidity, luminosity, sound, and vibration. The pillow is able to forward the gathered information to a server through a wireless router with a static NAT configuration. Subsequently, user and medical staff can obtain the information and determine their quality of sleep. Furthermore, they are able to change the actions performed by the AAL system and the respective thresholds of the cushion. Architecture and algorithm of the system list circumstances that can reduce sleep quality and the actions intelligent devices perform to improve the sleep quality of the user. The paper shows the code for data acquisition and pertinent calibration of all sensors. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Wearable medical devices with sensor continuously generate enormous data which is often called as big data mixed with structured and unstructured data. Due to the complexity of the data, it is difficult to process and analyze the big data for finding valuable information that can be useful in decision-making. On the other hand, data security is a key requirement in healthcare big data system. In order to overcome this issue, this paper proposes a new architecture for the implementation of IoT to store and process scalable sensor data (big data) for health care applications. The Proposed architecture consists of two main sub architectures, namely, Meta Fog-Redirection (MF-R) and Grouping and Choosing (GC) architecture. MF-R architecture uses big data technologies such as Apache Pig and Apache HBase for collection and storage of the sensor data (big data) generated from different sensor devices. The proposed GC architecture is used for securing integration of fog computing with cloud computing. This architecture also uses key management service and data categorization function (Sensitive, Critical and Normal) for providing security services. The framework also uses MapReduce based prediction model to predict the heart diseases. Performance evaluation parameters such as throughput, sensitivity, accuracy, and f-measure are calculated to prove the efficiency of the proposed architecture as well as the prediction model. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era, there is an increasing trend to enable intelligent behavior in edge computing sensors. Thus, a new generation of smart wearable devices for health monitoring is being developed, able to perform complex Digital Signal Processing (DSP) routines that extract features of clinical relevance from the acquired data. These new edge computing sensors for personalized healthcare must operate within a tight energy envelope; addressing the ensuing challenge, we herein introduce an inexact and heterogeneous edge computing architecture, specifically tailored to the bio-DSP domain. We observe that bio-signal analysis applications present task-level parallelism, intensive computational hotspots and a high degree of resilience towards errors. These characteristics drive our new bio-DSP edge node architecture design composed of multiple processing cores, a Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA) accelerator, and hardware-software co-design support to become resilient to a non-zero probability of bit-flips at runtime. All these characteristics enable our new bio-DSP architecture to operate with an ultra-low voltage operating point. Indeed our results indicate that the energy benefits attained from the inclusion of all these characteristics in bio-DSP architectures are more than additive: task parallelism is harnessed both at the processor and the accelerator level, and the high tolerance of the CGRA towards voltage down-scaling is exploited to further decrease the IoT edge bio-DSP system energy envelope. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Mobile edge computing (MEC) provides a promising approach to significantly reduce network operational cost and improve quality of service (QoS) of mobile users by pushing computation resources to the network edges, and enables a scalable Internet of Things (IoT) architecture for time-sensitive applications (e-healthcare, real-time monitoring, and so on.). However, the mobility of mobile users and the limited coverage of edge servers can result in significant network performance degradation, dramatic drop in QoS, and even interruption of ongoing edge services; therefore, it is difficult to ensure service continuity. Service migration has great potential to address the issues, which decides when or where these services are migrated following user mobility and the changes of demand. In this paper, two conceptions similar to service migration, i.e., live migration for data centers and handover in cellular networks, are first discussed. Next, the cutting-edge research efforts on service migration in MEC are reviewed, and a devisal of taxonomy based on various research directions for efficient service migration is presented. Subsequently, a summary of three technologies for hosting services on edge servers, i.e., virtual machine, container, and agent, is provided. At last, open research challenges in service migration are identified and discussed. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The advancement of next-generation network technologies provides a huge improvement in healthcare facilities. Technologies such as 5G, edge computing, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things realize smart healthcare that a client can have anytime, anywhere, and in real time. Edge computing offers useful computing resources at the edge of the network to maintain low-latency and real-time computing. In this article, we propose a smart healthcare framework using edge computing. In the framework, we develop a voice disorder assessment and treatment system using a deep learning approach. A client provides his or her voice sample captured by smart sensors, and the sample goes to the edge computing for initial processing. Then the edge computing sends data to a core cloud for further processing. The assessment and management are controlled by a service provider through a cloud manager. Once the automatic assessment is done, the decision is sent to specialists, who prescribe appropriate treatment to the clients. The proposed system achieves 98.5 percent accuracy and 99.3 percent sensitivity using the Saarbrucken Voice Disorder database. © 1979-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Chikungunya virus is an infection which is transmitted to humans by the bite of Aedes agypti and Aedes albopictis mosquitoes. It causes deterioration in health leading to multiorgan failure. Diagnostic tests for this virus are not easily available and affordable in developing countries. The medical technologies are not so efficient in diagnosing and preventing the outbreak of Chikungunya virus. Healthcare services based on a fog-cloud technology are emerging as a proactive and effective solution to provide remote detection and monitoring of users. A fog assisted healthcare system can be used to diagnose users infected by Chikungunya virus in an initial state of their infection so that proper treatment can be given to them on time to enable fast recovery. In this paper, a fog assisted cloud-based healthcare system is designed to diagnose and prevent the outbreak of this virus. Initially, a decision tree is used to classify the category of user's infection depending on his/her health symptoms and diagnostic alerts are immediately generated on the user's mobile phone from fog layer. Furthermore, the state of Chikungunya virus outbreak is represented using temporal network analysis (TNA) on cloud layer using proximity data. Various outbreak metrics from TNA graph are calculated which indicate the probability to receive or transmit Chikungunya infection to human beings. Results depict that J48 decision tree classifier has higher accuracy and lower response time in determining the level of Chikungunya virus infection as compared to other classification algorithms. Moreover, alert generation based on real-time healthcare data further enhances the utility of the proposed system. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={With the invention of new communication technologies, new features and facilities are provided in a smart healthcare framework. The features and facilities aim to provide a seamless, easy-to-use, accurate, and real-time healthcare service to clients. As health is a sensitive issue, it should be taken care of with utmost security and caution. This article proposes a new medical image forgery detection system for the healthcare framework to verify that images related to healthcare are not changed or altered. The system works on a noise map of an image, applies a multi-resolution regression filter on the noise map, and feeds the output to support-vector-machine-based and extreme-learning-based classifiers. The noise map is created in an edge computing resource, while the filtering and classification are done in a core cloud computing resource. In this way, the system works seamlessly and in real time. The bandwidth requirement of the proposed system is also reasonable. © 1979-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The smart health paradigms employ Internet-connected wearables for telemonitoring, diagnosis for providing inexpensive healthcare solutions. Fog computing reduces latency and increases throughput by processing data near the body sensor network. In this paper, we proposed a secure service-orientated edge computing architecture that is validated on recently released public dataset. Results and discussions support the applicability of proposed architecture for smart health applications. We proposed SoA-Fog i.e. a three-tier secure framework for efficient management of health data using fog devices. It discuss the security aspects in client layer, fog layer and the cloud layer. We design the prototype by using win-win spiral model with use case and sequence diagram. Overlay analysis was performed using proposed framework on malaria vector borne disease positive maps of Maharastra state in India from 2011 to 2014. The mobile clients were taken as test case. We performed comparative analysis between proposed secure fog framework and state-of-the art cloud-based framework. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The increasing use of wearables in smart telehealth system led to the generation of large medical big data. Cloud and fog services leverage these data for assisting clinical procedures. IoT Healthcare has been benefited from this large pool of generated data. This paper suggests the use of low-resource machine learning on Fog devices kept close to wearables for smart telehealth. For traditional telecare systems, the signal processing and machine learning modules are deployed in the cloud that processes physiological data. This paper presents a Fog architecture that relied on unsupervised machine learning big data analysis for discovering patterns in physiological data. We developed a prototype using Intel Edison and Raspberry Pi that was tested on real-world pathological speech data from telemonitoring of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Proposed architecture employed machine learning for analysis of pathological speech data obtained from smart watches worn by the patients with PD. Results show that proposed architecture is promising for low-resource machine learning. It could be useful for other applications within wearable IoT for smart telehealth scenarios by translating machine learning approaches from the cloud backend to edge computing devices such as Fog. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The Fog Computing paradigm proposes an extension of the cloud-based computing to the network edges in the Internet of Things. It facilitates localized analysis closer to the data sources for improved responsiveness of the system as well as cloud-based learning for historical analysis. In this paper, we present our fog-enabled Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) system for activity monitoring and localization in the context of Ambient Assisted Living. Our WSN architecture consists of two types of devices - a wearable sensor device and a cloud gateway node. We discuss our Edge Mining approach for real-time activity classification on the sensor device as well as the Genetic Algorithm used for cloud-based analysis. The design of our analytical framework together with the communication model addresses the challenge of sensor-cloud integration. We evaluate the performance of our system for outdoor localization of the elderly. The analysis is based on acceleration data collected using our wearable device across different activity sequences obtained from the Kasteren dataset. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications give rise to an unprecedented amount of data that requires transfer, processing/analysis and storage. Often times, the norm is to maximize the capability of cloud computing services and infrastructure in running complex algorithms on data associated with IoT devices, in order to extract useful information, as well as harnessing its storage services. The downsides of employing cloud computing services include unacceptable latency, high storage cost, increased network bandwidth, etc. However, edge computing eliminates the problems of data communication latency of cloud computing, by processing data at its source. Thus, devices not continuously connected to the Internet can be used for data processing and analysis. Also due to the heterogeneous nature of devices used in data collection, the necessary data integration prior to analysis poses a challenge to developers of IoT solutions and products. The use of a middleware platform was harnessed to solve this problem. In this paper, we employ the use of an edge computing platform for analyzing data generated by IoT devices used in providing healthcare services. This is especially important as such services require real-Time analytical results for health monitoring and diagnosis. The system depicted in this work is based on a proposed patient-centric architecture for remotely monitoring patients, and comprises of a biosensor, a smartphone, and an edge analytics platform for data analysis. The biosensor (heart rate sensor) used for this work collects physiological data from the patient and sends it via Bluetooth to the smartphone, which hosts a mobile application, 'HealthMate', that pre-processes the sensor data, transfers it to the edge computing platform server, Kaa server, for further data analysis and storage. The analyzed sensor data is sent back to the mobile application on the smartphone for real-Time visualization if required. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is a novel discipline that aims at improving the quality of life for all generations, especially the elderly, with the help of information and communication technologies. Behavioral tracking AAL systems necessitate the monitoring and understanding of daily activities and preferences of the user for design of customized, context-aware services and detection of behavior anomalies. Localization of the user is, therefore, key to facilitate real-time activity monitoring in AAL applications. Although several localization techniques have been proposed to date, majority of them incur a high operational cost owing to dependency on dense sensor deployments for ambient intelligence or use of expensive hardware such as GPS receivers. In this paper, we propose a low-cost Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) system, comprising of a single wearable device and a cloud gateway, for outdoor localization in the context of AAL. With the inception of the Fog Computing paradigm, we consider the implementation of a light-weight data mining technique, Iterative Edge Mining (IEM), on the wearable device for on-board activity recognition. IEM is based on the classification of signal distributions to enable real-time mobility tracking as the user moves around an environment. Given the topology information and the activity sequence generated by the algorithm, we estimate the user location by associating the distance covered over time with the orientation values. Alerts are signaled locally upon detection of behavior anomalies and transmitted to the gateway node using a delay-tolerant communication framework. As such, IEM runs autonomously on the sensor node without interaction with external objects, thereby, improving the responsiveness as well as the operational cost of our system. We evaluate the performance of IEM in terms of localization accuracy in an outdoor environment. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The issue of utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) in Healthcare solutions relates to the problems of latency sensitivity, uneven data load, diverse user expectations and heterogeneity of the applications. Current explorations consider Cloud Computing as the base stone to create IoT-Enable solution. Nonetheless, this environment entails limitations in terms of multi-hop distance from the data source, geographical centralized architecture, economical aspects, etc. To address these limitations, there is a surge of solutions that apply Fog Computing as an approach to bring computing resources closer to the data sources. This approach is being fomented by the growing availability of powerful edge computing at lower cost and commercial developments in the area. Nonetheless, the implementation of Cloud-Fog interoperability and integration implies in complex coordination of applications and services and the demand for intelligent service orchestrations so that solutions can make the best use of distributed resources without compromising stability, quality of services, and security. In this paper, we introduce a Fog-based IoT-Healthcare solution structure and explore the integration of Cloud-Fog services in interoperable Healthcare solutions extended upon the traditional Cloud-based structure. The scenarios are evaluated through simulations using the iFogSim simulator and the results analyzed in relation to distributed computing, reduction of latency, optimization of data communication, and power consumption. The experimental results point towards improvement in instance cost, network delay and energy usage. © 2018 ACM. 978-1-4503-6372-3/18/01. . . $15.00.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) aims to bring every object, such as smart cameras, wearable devices, etc., online, hence generating massive amounts of data that can submerge storage systems. The Cloud computing paradigm is unable to meet these requirements, particularly in some critical applications (as health monitoring, emergency response, etc.) that require low latency, and delay caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to the application can seriously impact their performances. To overcome this limitation, Edge paradigms, as Fog computing, Edge computing and Mobile Cloud computing, have been proposed, where cloud services are extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and network congestion. This paper proposes a software architecture supporting the modelling of Edge computing dedicated systems. The current situation of emerging Edge paradigms is analyzed in detail. An approach based on software component technology is proposed and applied using Fractal components model, which can specify semantics of every-changing dynamic and distributed integration of software components. Furthermore, a case study of the patient monitoring system (PMS-EDGE) along with its application model and network topology is expounded. Copyright © by the paper’s authors.},

abstract={The healthcare sector is now blending with Information and Communications Technology (ICT) using Internet of Things (IoT) to potentially minimise medical errors and reduce healthcare cost. Patients are now embedded with smart devices like body sensors and wearable devices which can monitor their health without the need for a doctor in physical contact. Such smart devices have the downside of low battery power and are unable to transmit their data to the medical personnel when the patient is on the move away from the smart home/smart clinic fixed gateway. A mobile gateway is required which moves with the patient to process the smart device data without depleting the smartphone battery. This paper proposes an Intelligent and Energy Efficient SG based smartphone Gateway for healthcare smart devices (IEE5GG). In IEE5GG, the 5G architecture is adopted and the patient's smartphone is used as a gateway where multiple smart devices are connected e.g. via Bluetooth. To save energy, requests to the smartphone can either be executed on the smartphone gateway or offloaded and executed in the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) cloud at close proximity to the smartphone in the 5G Base Station (BS) central Unit (gNB-CU) while considering the transmission power, Quality of Service (QoS), smartphone battery level and Central Processing Unit (CPU) load. Results show that the proposed IEE5GG framework saves up to 38% of energy in the healthcare mobile gateway smartphone and reduces healthcare application service time by up to 41%. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) offers a seamless platform to connect people and objects to one another for enriching and making our lives easier. This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as smart wearables, smart home, smart mobility, and smart cities. In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, device–network–human interfaces, security, and privacy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Virtualization of computational hardware resource has been around for years and it has proved itself as an effective solution, enabling more flexible resource management which supports Cloud computing. Beside the traditional hypervisor-based virtualization, another concept co-exists – container-based virtualization. In container-based virtualization, the virtualization layer runs as an application within the operating system, which is much lighter compared to hypervisor. However, in recent times, there is also tendency to apply a virtualization approach of network resources, due to growth of quantity of data that has to be transmitted and increasing number of mobile and wearable devices, which requires more robust and flexible network management. In networking, two important new concepts have emerged: Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV). Both of them enable novel ways of design, implementation, configuration and management of computer networks and show potential of network performance improvement and cost reduction in previously mentioned conditions. In this paper, we focus on Network Functions Virtualization and present a model-driven, semantics-enabled framework for automated, (re-)deployment of containerized Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and generation of SDN OpenFlow and network overlay rules as a result. We decide to use container-based virtualization approach in order to decrease the overhead induced by the hypervisor layer, speed-up the deployment and increase the overall flexibility which is crucial in many novel use cases, especially when it comes to Edge Computing. © 2018 IADIS Press.

abstract={With the advent of pervasive computing and ubiquitous services in today’s life, there are numerous data-centric services boosted by IoT. Moreover, mobile devices and their utility have resulted in a huge amount of digital data content which fails to maintain QoS. Standalone IoT cannot handle all these huge data, which resulted in the merging of IoT with cloud computing. Similarly, the retrieval of required data has become more time-consuming with the exponential increase of IoT devices. In order to remove these shortcomings, we propose an IoT-enabled three-layered architecture to process huge data and support high-end processing, which is completely suitable for data transaction supporting IoT services. In this three-layered novel architecture, each layer is collectively responsible for data emission, data retrieval, or data processing, thus completing the data transaction process. A case study on smart healthcare system presents the efficacy of the model. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={A large spectrum of healthcare applications, ranging from continuous blood sugar level monitoring to sleep apnea detection are nowadays facilitated by modern mobile gadgets. Wearable and ambient sensors generate enormous amounts of physiological data that demand high computation power for real-time processing and large storage area for recording the personal data. In order to conserve the energy on the battery-limited mainstream mobile devices of the end-users, the execution of the healthcare applications may be offloaded to a remote server. While cloud computing provides unlimited pool of resources for latency-tolerant services such as training a machine learning model, the personalization of healthcare services and the delay sensitivity of continuous health assessment necessitate a computation infrastructure in the vicinity of the end-users. As a remedy to address various demands of a wide range of pervasive healthcare applications, we propose a multi-tier computing and communication architecture composed of end-user devices, edge servers, and legacy cloud data-centers. The dynamic management of this architecture, policies to be applied within the network and the orchestration of the healthcare services are carried out by the concept of programmable networks, in the form of software-defined networking (SDN). As a concrete demonstration of our ideas, a fall risk assessment service is implemented and an experimental study is conducted to evaluate its accuracy and the performance of the multi-tier architecture.

abstract={The smart health paradigms employ Internet-connected wearables for tele-monitoring, diagnosis providing inexpensive healthcare solutions. Mist computing reduces latency and increases throughput by processing data near the edge of the network. In the present paper, we proposed a secure mist Computing architecture that is validated on recently released public geospatial health dataset. Results and discussion support the efficacy of proposed architecture for smart geospatial health applications. The present research paper proposed SoA-Mist i.e. a three-tier secure framework for efficient management of geospatial health data with the use of mist devices. It proposed the security aspects in client layer, mist layer, fog layer and cloud layer. It has defined the prototype development by using win-win spiral model with use case and sequence diagram. Overlay analysis has been performed with the developed framework on malaria vector borne disease positive maps of Maharastra state in India from 2011 to 2014 in mobile clients as test case. Finally, It concludes with the comparison analysis of cloud based framework and proposed SoA-Mist framework. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The contradiction between the limited capability of lightweight Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and ever-increasing user demands is a fundamental and challenging problem in the era of IoT. One of the most important challenges is that lightweight IoT devices are generally embedded with fixed applications on resource-constrained hardware, and cannot enable on-demand service provisioning. In this paper, we propose BOAT, a block-streaming application execution scheme based on transparent computing (TC), which can remotely retrieve the necessary parts of traditional applications from edge servers on demand and run them on IoT devices locally. Specifically, we first exploit TC to build a scalable IoT system, where the applications of lightweight IoT devices are stored in edge servers or cloud but can be dynamically loaded on IoT devices in a block-streaming way. Moreover, we present a code partition approach to split the codes of a whole service into numerous functional blocks at the edge side. Such that, IoT devices only need to load necessary blocks of an application to obtain the requested services without loading the whole application codes. A lightweight I/O virtualization mechanism and a fine-grained relocation technology are then developed to support the block-streaming service loading. Our experimental results on a lightweight wearable device demonstrate that the proposed scheme can efficiently achieve flexible service provisioning with improved scalability and reduced service loading delay and energy consumption. © 2018 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.

abstract={Abstract: eHealth systems have adopted recent advances on sensing technologies together with advances in information and communication technologies (ICT) in order to provide people-centered services that improve the quality of life of an increasingly elderly population. As these eHealth services are founded on the acquisition and processing of sensitive data (e.g., personal details, diagnosis, treatments and medical history), any security threat would damage the public’s confidence in them. This paper proposes a solution for the design and runtime management of indoor eHealth applications with security requirements. The proposal allows applications definition customized to patient particularities, including the early detection of health deterioration and suitable reaction (events) as well as security needs. At runtime, security support is twofold. A secured component-based platform supervises applications execution and provides events management, whilst the security of the communications among application components is also guaranteed. Additionally, the proposed event management scheme adopts the fog computing paradigm to enable local event related data storage and processing, thus saving communication bandwidth when communicating with the cloud. As a proof of concept, this proposal has been validated through the monitoring of the health status in diabetic patients at a nursing home. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Thousands of people have lost their lives in stampedes and other crowd related disasters in recent years. Most of these fatalities seem to have been caused by poor control and management of crowds, which is discussed in this article. An efficient and effective crowd management system must also have a plan to deal with the ongoing threat of terrorism and outbreak of various kinds of communicable diseases. In this article, we present a framework of a Crowd Control and Health Management System specially designed to prevent and manage stampedes and other disasters. The system has two subsystems; one for dealing with the management of stampedes and other disasters and the other with healthcare management. As part of the proposed system, an algorithm for an early detection of stampedes, with proof and simulation of implementation, is provided. As part of the healthcare management subsystem, we integrate several mobile applications and develop four of them dealing with relief issues, blood donations, complaints and alerts, and utilizing mobile phones as a sensor device. Our system makes use of various kinds of wireless, mobile, and other technologies and tools including Fog Computing, Smart Phones, Smart Digital Street, IP-Cameras, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Voice Alarm, Light Alarm, and Global Positioning System (GPS). We compare merits and effectiveness of RFID and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), as well as those of Cloud and Fog with a view of using them as part of the proposed framework. We also discuss applications of our systems in real-life cases of Hajj, an annual pilgrimage of millions of people to Mecca, and Kumbh Mela, a periodic gathering of tens of millions of people in India, both of which have accounted for the majority of fatalities in stampedes and other disasters. © 2018 Mohammad Yamin et al.},

abstract={Current developments in ICTs such as in Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS) allow us to develop healthcare solutions with more intelligent and prediction capabilities both for daily life (home/office) and in-hospitals. In most of IoT-based healthcare systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, a bridging point (i.e., gateway) is needed between sensor infrastructure network and the Internet. The gateway at the edge of the network often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways at the edge of the network to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., presenting thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. We then propose to exploit the concept of Fog Computing in Healthcare IoT systems by forming a Geo-distributed intermediary layer of intelligence between sensor nodes and Cloud. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, our Fog-assisted system architecture can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as mobility, energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways can enable massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a prototype of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UT-GATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented. We also implement an IoT-based Early Warning Score (EWS) health monitoring to practically show the efficiency and relevance of our system on addressing a medical case study. Our proof-of-concept design demonstrates an IoT-based health monitoring system with enhanced overall system intelligence, energy efficiency, mobility, performance, interoperability, security, and reliability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The increasing amount of user equipment (UE) and the rapid advances in wireless body area networks bring revolutionary changes in healthcare systems. However, due to the strict requirements on size, reliability and battery lifetime of UE devices, it is difficult for them to execute latency sensitive or computation intensive tasks effectively. In this paper, we aim to enhance the UE computation capacity by utilizing small size coordinator-based mobile edge computing (C-MEC) servers. In this way, the system complexity, computation resources, and energy consumption are considerably transferred from the UE to the C-MEC, which is a practical approach since C-MEC is power charged, in contrast to the UE. First, the system architecture and the mobility model are presented. Second, several transmission mechanisms are analyzed along with the proposed mobility-aware cooperative task offloading scheme. Numerous selected performance metrics are investigated regarding the number of executed tasks, the percentage of failed tasks, average service time, and the energy consumption of each MEC. The results validate the advantage of task offloading schemes compared with the traditional relay-based technique regarding the number of executed tasks. Moreover, one can obtain that the proposed scheme archives noteworthy benefits, such as low latency and efficiently balance the energy consumption of C-MECs. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={We propose a new framework combining dynamic sampling rates for healthcare sensors driven by user behavior, and an adaptive MAC scheduling scheme applied to the time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) protocol in IEEE 802.15.4, which provides high throughput and reliable communications. First, we introduce a system software architecture for machine-learning-assisted healthcare monitoring that detects the user's behavior using edge computing and adjusts the sampling rates of the healthcare sensors accordingly. Second, we propose an adaptive MAC scheduling scheme for TSCH based on a state machine model that reacts to the dynamic traffic generated by the healthcare sensors. In case of an urgent state, the MAC scheduler automatically allocates extra timeslots to the appropriate sensors so as to enable the reliable transfer of high-resolution sensor data for further analysis. Experimental results from our testbed, implemented in Contiki-OS on the OpenMote-CC2538 platform, show that the proposed adaptive scheduling scheme can respond quickly to changes in user behavior and ensure the reliable transfer of sensor data in emergency situations. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Mobile edge cloud is emerging as a promising technology to internet of things and cyber physical system applications such as smart home and intelligent video surveillance. In smart home, various sensors are deployed to monitor the home environment and physiological health of individuals. The data collected by sensors are sent to an application, where numerous algorithms for emotion and sentiment detection, activity recognition and situation management are applied to provide healthcare- and emergency-related services and to manage resources at the home. The executions of these algorithms require a vast amount of computing and storage resources. To address the issue, the conventional approach is to send the collected data to an application on an internet cloud. This approach has several problems such as high communication latency, communication energy consumption and unnecessary data traffic to the core network. To overcome the drawbacks of the conventional cloud-based approach, a new system called mobile edge cloud is proposed. In mobile edge cloud, multiple mobile and stationary devices interconnected through wireless local area networks are combined to create a small cloud infrastructure at a local physical area such as home. Compared to traditional mobile distributed computing systems, mobile edge cloud introduces several complex challenges due to the heterogeneous computing environment, heterogeneous and dynamic network environment, node mobility, and limited battery power. The real time requirements associated with internet of things and cyber physical system applications make the problem even more challenging. In this paper, we describe the applications and challenges associated with design and development of mobile edge cloud system and propose an architecture based on a cross layer design approach for effective decision making. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In data-intensive real-time applications, e.g., cognitive assistance and mobile health (mHealth), the amount of sensor data is exploding. In these applications, it is desirable to extract value-added information, e.g., mental or physical health conditions, from sensor data streams in real-time rather than overloading users with massive raw data. However, achieving the objective is challenging due to the data volume and complex data analysis tasks with stringent timing constraints. Most existing big data management systems, e.g., Hadoop, are not directly applicable to real-time sensor data analytics, since they are timing agnostic and focus on batch processing of previously stored data that are potentially outdated and subject to I/O overheads. Moreover, embedded sensors and IoT devices lack enough resources to perform sophisticated data analytics. To address the problem, we design a new real-time big data management framework to support periodic in-memory real-time sensor data analytics at the network edge by extending the map-reduce model originated in functional programming, while providing adaptive sensor data transfer to the edge server based on data importance. In this paper, a prototype system is designed and implemented as a proof of concept. In the performance evaluation, it is empirically shown that important sensor data are delivered in a preferred manner and they are analyzed in a timely fashion. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={This paper focuses on 5G Mobile Systems for ultra-reliable low latency communications applied to the healthcare use cases, specifically: Wireless Tele Surgery (WTS) - using a mobile console and robotic platforms with video, audio and haptic feed-back; and Wireless Service Robots (WSR) - companion robots or service robots performing tasks of social caretakers, professional personnel or family members. Cyber-sickness and latency between robotic platforms and reasoning servers are the new technical problems the 5G mobile systems are expected to solve, e.g. in hospices, hospitals, homes and campus areas. We firstly describe the 5G functional architecture and key enabling technologies to meet the associated performance requirements. This is followed by a comprehensive analysis of costs and revenues operators and healthcare providers would meet to deliver the corresponding services, if 5G systems were deployed. Business case calculations for the two players show an immediate Return on Investment (RoI) for carriers, whereas the breakeven point for healthcare providers is highly sensitive to the robotic platform price. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In the field of smart environments, many devices and multimedia oriented connected objects has gained a significant attention in the last years. In such a domain, there is a large number of heterogeneous specific profiles (user devices, connected objects, smart homes, health sensors⋯). These profiles are highly dynamic, according to different contexts (user profile, user environment, monitoring, social activities⋯). There is a critical need to offer to users a flexible and efficient services selection among a large set of candidates based on their surrounding environments, user's current needs and situations. In this paper, we propose a two layered architecture including a local server (Fog computing), a central Cloud providing an efficient situation management and good scalability. We particularly focus on context-aware e-health mobile applications for achieving the efficient and quality diagnosis of complex situations and for providing all distributed multimedia services that help users to access/broadcast multimedia documents. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={With the development of medical sensors and IoT, personalized service assisted elder and patient living is a critical service in IoT-based healthcare application. However, the scale and complexity of personalized service is increasing because of ubiquitous deployment of various kinds of medical sensors, which cause response time increase and resource waste. Therefore, leveraging the advantage of complex event processing (CEP) in data stream processing, we propose a hierarchical fog-cloud computing CEP architecture for personalized service to accelerate response time and reduce resource waste. Firstly, we introduce the proposed architecture, which includes sensor layer, fog layer and cloud layer. Secondly, we propose a series of optimizations for the architecture, there are a partitioning and clustering approach and a communication and parallel processing policy to optimize the fog and cloud computing. Finally, we implement a prototype system based on the architecture named FogCepCare. Experimental result shows that FogCepCare is superior to the traditional IoT-based healthcare application. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has embraced a 'vertical' off-loading model, where avalanches of raw data generated by numerous edge devices are continuously pushed through the network to a remote processing location, such as a datacenter or a cloud. In this rather unbalanced architecture, edge devices are typically not expected to perform sophisticated data processing and analytics, and data fusion takes place remotely from the original source of data. As a result, the underlying network and the remote datacenter have to handle increased amounts of unstructured raw data, which, in turn, may affect the overall performance and decrease reaction times. As a potential solution to these shortcomings, this paper introduces a distributed hierarchical data fusion architecture for the IoT networks, consisting of edge devices, network and communications units, and cloud platforms. According to the proposed approach, different data sources are combined at each level of the IoT hierarchy to produce timely and accurate results by utilising computational capabilities of intermediate nodes. This way, mission-critical decisions, as demonstrated by the presented smart healthcare scenario, are taken with minimum time delay, as soon as necessary information is generated and collected. The initial evaluation suggests that the proposed approach enables fine-grained decision taking at different data fusion levels, and, as a result, improves the overall performance and reaction time. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={In the last years, the emergence of pervasive connected devices and the development of the cloud computing paradigms brought a revolution in health-care and industrial applications. Cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) exploit large scale service providers to vastly reduce costs and gather Big Data. However, cloud-based services still face various issues related to: high bandwidth requirements, unpredictable delays, and security and safety concerns. These issues are critical to health-care and Active and Assisted Living (AAL) where a correct and timely reaction can result in saving a life or drastically reducing a disability (e.g. after a stroke). In this scenario, we present a flexible multi-level architecture using the fog approach, a computing paradigm in which heterogeneous devices at the edge of the network collect data, compute a task with minimal latency, and produce physical actions meaningful for the user, leveraging upon context and location awareness. In this paper, we envision also an edge node built upon Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. The hardware of a FPGA node can be reconfigured to produce maximum performance in tasks, to guarantee a minimal delay, or the capacity to scale on the number of devices connected, with a minimal power consumption. We present two case studies for assistive smart ambients and health applications designed on our Fog architecture. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Anomaly detection is important for time-critical Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as healthcare and emergency management. The recent introduction of Fog computing architecture provides an efficient platform for delay sensitive IoT applications. Exploiting the advantages of Fog computing for anomaly detection provides the ability to detect abnormal patterns in an accurate and timely manner. Use of Centralized and Distributed anomaly detection methods suffer from significant latency and energy consumption issues. Hence, we propose a novel anomaly detection method, called Fog-Empowered anomaly detection, by harnessing the processing power of the Fog computing platform and using an efficient hyperellipsoidal clustering algorithm. The end nodes in the Fog computing architecture do not perform any processing or clustering on the data. The Fog layer and the Cloud layer nodes perform the clustering and anomaly detection process, thus helping to achieve anomaly detection in a timely manner. The evaluation using synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that our proposed approach achieves a significant reduction in latency and energy consumption compared to the Distributed and Centralized schemes, while achieving a comparable detection accuracy compared to a Centralized scheme. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The current enhancement and technical development in radio communication have enabled the efficient, low power, intelligent, and wearable microsensor. These microsensors are tactically embedded in or located outside the human body in a fixed position, which is called Body Area Network (WBAN). Therefore, the key objective of this research work is to discover the current gaps in providing an improved service of WBAN. The paper presents a Fog-based Healthcare Architecture for Wearable Body Area Network (FHA). The fog based architecture is used for real-time patient monitoring and analysis of patients' health condition irrespective of location and time by using an integrated low-power and low-cost WBAN and fog computing. In order to diagnose and monitor the patient's health conditions, mobile wearable sensors are used to gather the patients' real-time data via ZigBee links and forward to the Tele-Lab Server (TLS). Where a Laboratory Information Database (LIDB) module resides that buffer and analyzes the data. The LIDB sends the whole information of all registered patients to the cloud server as a backup. When TLS frequently sends data to the fog server, it creates congestion, the proposed technique avoids the congestion on fog server. When FHA predicts the critical result of any patient, it immediately forwards the data to the fog server for emergency alert and updates the cloud server. From the simulation results, it is observed that the proposed FHA efficiently handle the current issues and increasing throughput, decreasing packet loss, and delay. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

abstract={Fog computing is considered as the most promising enhancement of the traditional cloud computing paradigm in order to handle potential issues introduced by the emerging Interned of Things (IoT) framework at the network edge. The heterogeneous nature, the extensive distribution and the hefty number of deployed IoT nodes will disrupt existing functional models, creating confusion. However, IoT will facilitate the rise of new applications, with automated healthcare monitoring platforms being amongst them. This paper presents the pillars of design for such applications, along with the evaluation of a working prototype that collects ECG traces from a tailor-made device and utilizes the patient's smartphone as a Fog gateway for securely sharing them to other authorized entities. This prototype will allow patients to share information to their physicians, monitor their health status independently and notify the authorities rapidly in emergency situations. Historical data will also be available for further analysis, towards identifying patterns that may improve medical diagnoses in the foreseeable future. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Nowadays, a large amount of services are deployed on the edge of the network from the cloud since processing data at the edge can reduce response time and lower bandwidth cost for applications such as healthcare in smart homes. Resource management is very important in the edge computing since it is able to increase the system efficiency and improve the quality of service. A common approach for resource management in edge computing is to assign tasks to the remote cloud or edge devices just according to several factors such as energy, bandwidth consumption, and latency. However, the approach is insufficiently efficient and falls short in meeting the requirements of handling health emergency when being applied in smart homes for healthcare. Possible health emergency needs immediate attention and different health tasks have different priorities to be processed. In this paper, we propose a task scheduling approach called HealthEdge that sets different processing priorities for different tasks based on the collected data on human health status and determines whether a task should run in a local device or a remote cloud in order to reduce its total processing time as much as possible. Based on a real trace from five patients, we conduct a trace-driven experiment to evaluate the performance of HealthEdge in comparison with other methods. The results show that HealthEdge can optimally assign tasks between the network edge and cloud, which can reduce the task processing time, reduce bandwidth consumption and increase local edge workstation utilization. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The HL7 standard was initially designed to enable interoperability of healthcare information within large hospitals. HL7's focus has recently been extended to regional healthcare cloud infrastructures but not yet reached the lightweight fog infrastructures emerging from niche healthcare areas such as body area networks (BANs) and the massive flow of personal medical records resulting from off-the-shelf e-health devices and networks. This paper addresses the issue of interoperability between fog and cloud computing platforms by i) proposing a framework for a standardized exchange of information between healthcare entities ii) designing and implementing a software tool to be integrated into medical data dissemination protocols to ensure interoperability and iii) evaluating the impact of the software tool on the transport of data when exchanging healthcare information using 'in-band' and 'out-band' transport over the IEEE802.15.4/ZigBee and WiFi protocols. Our results reveal that, for the lightweight devices used by fog infrastructures, 'out-band' transport over WiFi with edge data translation into HL7 records is a better option than 'in-band' transport. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm holds significant promises for remote health monitoring systems. Due to their life- or mission-critical nature, these systems need to provide a high level of availability and accuracy. On the one hand, centralized cloud-based IoT systems lack reliability, punctuality and availability (e.g., in case of slow or unreliable Internet connection), and on the other hand, fully outsourcing data analytics to the edge of the network can result in diminished level of accuracy and adaptability due to the limited computational capacity in edge nodes. In this paper, we tackle these issues by proposing a hierarchical computing architecture, HiCH, for IoT-based health monitoring systems. The core components of the proposed system are 1) a novel computing architecture suitable for hierarchical partitioning and execution of machine learning based data analytics, 2) a closed-loop management technique capable of autonomous system adjustments with respect to patient's condition. HiCH benefits from the features offered by both fog and cloud computing and introduces a tailored management methodology for healthcare IoT systems. We demonstrate the efficacy of HiCH via a comprehensive performance assessment and evaluation on a continuous remote health monitoring case study focusing on arrhythmia detection for patients suffering from CardioVascular Diseases (CVDs). © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in Internet of Things (IoT) from centralized cloud computing to edge computing (or fog computing). Developments in ICT have resulted in the significant increment of communication and computation capabilities of embedded devices and this will continue to increase in coming years. However, existing paradigms do not utilize low-level devices for any decision-making process. In fact, gateway devices are also utilized mostly for communication interoperability and some low-level processing. In this paper, we have proposed a new computing paradigm, named Edge Mesh, which distributes the decision-making tasks among edge devices within the network instead of sending all the data to a centralized server. All the computation tasks and data are shared using a mesh network of edge devices and routers. Edge Mesh provides many benefits, including distributed processing, low latency, fault tolerance, better scalability, better security, and privacy. These benefits are useful for critical applications, which require higher reliability, real-time processing, mobility support, and context awareness. We first give an overview of existing computing paradigms to establish the motivation behind Edge Mesh. Then, we describe in detail about the Edge Mesh computing paradigm, including the proposed software framework, research challenges, and benefits of Edge Mesh. We have also described the task management framework and done a preliminary study on task allocation problem in Edge Mesh. Different application scenarios, including smart home, intelligent transportation system, and healthcare, are presented to illustrate the significance of Edge Mesh computing paradigm. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={We perform an extensive study of medical applications that will potentially execute on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), from an edge computing perspective. Using this study, we perform a workload characterization of potential IoMT applications and explore the microarchitecture implications of these applications. Our study includes workloads spanning a variety of medical applications including medical image processing algorithms, inverse Radon transform, and implantable heart monitors. We compare these workloads' characteristics to an existing embedded systems benchmark suite, MiBench, to reveal their differences and similarities. The analysis presented herein will enable the study and design of right-provisioned microprocessors for the IoMT, and provide a framework for studying the execution characteristics of workloads in other emerging Internet of Things application domains. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we are visualizing a military health service (MHS) platform which is based on hierarchical IoT architecture. We propose a semantic Edge based network model which plays a significant role for communicating tactical and non-tactical piece of information over the network. Further, the exchange of information and subsequent data analysis on the MHS makes the system intelligent and smart. In any standard battlefield scenario, there is a command and control center that correlates the events happening in real time. We have made this command and control center as semantic edge component. This center is entrusted with making vital decisions on the tactical arena of the battlefield. The main aim of the proposed architecture is to provide secured zone to monitor soldiers health and their weapons conditions, respectively. We have also introduced the semantic edge computing mechanism to deal with the large amount of health data in terms of processing, storing and sharing information. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) evolves very rapidly over time, since everything such as sensors/actuators linked together from around the world with use of evolution of ubiquitous computing through the Internet. These devices have a unique IP address in order to communicate with each other and transmit data with features of wireless technologies. Fog computing or so called edge computing brings all Cloud features to embedded devices at edge network and adds more features to servers like pre-store data of Cloud, fast response, and generate overhasty users reporting. Fog mediates between Cloud and IoT devices and thus enables new types of computing and services. The future applications take the advantage of combing the two concepts Fog and Cloud in order to provide low delay Fog-based and high capacity of storage Cloud-based. This paper proposes an IoT architecture for healthcare network based on Fog to Cloud and Data in Motion (F2CDM). The proposed architecture is designed and implemented over three sites: Site 1 contains the embedded devices layer, Site 2 consists of the Fog network layer, while Site 3 consists of the Cloud network. The Fog layer is represented by a middleware server in Al-Nahrain University with temporary storage such that the data lives inside for 30 min. During this time, the selection of up-normality in behavior is send to the Cloud while the rest of the data is wiped out. On the other hand, the Cloud stores all the incoming data from Fog permanently. The F2CDM works using Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) for fast response. The results show that all data can be monitored from the Fog in real time while the critical data can be monitored from Cloud. In addition, the response time is evaluated using traffic generator called Tsung. It has been found that the proposed architecture reduces traffic on Cloud network and provides better data analysis. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Recently, big data analytics has received important attention in a variety of application domains including business, finance, space science, healthcare, telecommunication and Internet of Things (IoT). Among these areas, IoT is considered as an important platform in bringing people, processes, data and things/objects together in order to enhance the quality of our everyday lives. However, the key challenges are how to effectively extract useful features from the massive amount of heterogeneous data generated by resource-constrained IoT devices in order to provide real-time information and feedback to the end-users, and how to utilize this data-aware intelligence in enhancing the performance of wireless IoT networks. Although there are parallel advances in cloud computing and edge computing for addressing some issues in data analytics, they have their own benefits and limitations. The convergence of these two computing paradigms, i.e., massive virtually shared pool of computing and storage resources from the cloud and real-time data processing by edge computing, could effectively enable live data analytics in wireless IoT networks. In this regard, we propose a novel framework for coordinated processing between edge and cloud computing/processing by integrating advantages from both the platforms. The proposed framework can exploit the network-wide knowledge and historical information available at the cloud center to guide edge computing units towards satisfying various performance requirements of heterogeneous wireless IoT networks. Starting with the main features, key enablers and the challenges of big data analytics, we provide various synergies and distinctions between cloud and edge processing. More importantly, we identify and describe the potential key enablers for the proposed edge-cloud collaborative framework, the associated key challenges and some interesting future research directions. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The recent technological advances related to computing, storage, cloud, networking and the unstoppable deployment of end-user devices, are all coining the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). IoT embraces a wide set of heterogeneous services in highly impacting societal sectors, such as Healthcare, Smart Transportation or Media delivery, all of them posing a diverse set of requirements, including real time response, low latency, or high capacity. In order to properly address such diverse set of requirements, the combined use of Cloud and Fog computing turns up as an emerging trend. Indeed, Fog provides low delay for services demanding real time response, constrained to support low capacity queries, whereas Cloud provides high capacity at the cost of a higher latency. It is with no doubt that a new strategy is required to ease the combined operation of cloud and fog infrastructures in IoT scenarios, also referred to as Combined Fog-Cloud (CFC), in terms of service execution performance metrics. To that end, in this paper, we introduce and formulate the QoS-aware service allocation problem for CFC architectures as an integer optimization problem, whose solution minimizes the latency experienced by the services while guaranteeing the fulfillment of the capacity requirements. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Lately, pervasive and ubiquitous computing services have been under focus of not only the research community, but developers as well. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time responses. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data has to be uploaded to the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, the cloud on the edge of the network, known as Fog or Micro Datacenter (MDC), plays an important role. Fog resides between the underlying Internet of Things (IoTs) and the mega datacenter cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. To achieve this, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework, which we propose in this paper. Fog has to deal with mobile nodes and IoTs, which involves objects and devices of different types having a fluctuating connectivity behavior. All such types of service customers have an unpredictable relinquish probability, since any object or device can stop using resources at any moment. In our proposed methodology for resource estimation and management through Fog computing, we take into account these factors and formulate resource management on the basis of fluctuating relinquish probability of the customer, service type, service price, and variance of the relinquish probability. With the intent of showing practical implications of our method, we implemented it on Crawdad real trace and Amazon EC2 pricing. Based on various services, differentiated through Amazon's price plans and historical record of Cloud Service Customers (CSCs), the model determines the amount of resources to be allocated. More loyal CSCs get better services, while for the contrary case, the provider reserves resources cautiously. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet-of-things (IoT) refer to the massive integration of electronic devices, vehicles, buildings, and other objects to collect and exchange data. It is the enabling technology for a plethora of applications touching various aspects of our lives, such as healthcare, wearables, surveillance, home automation, smart manufacturing, and intelligent automotive systems. Existing IoT architectures are highly centralized and heavily rely on a back-end core network for all decision-making processes. This may lead to inefficiencies in terms of latency, network traffic management, computational processing, and power consumption. In this paper, we advocate the empowerment of front-end IoT devices to support the back-end network in fulfilling end-user applications requirements mainly by means of improved connectivity and efficient network management. A novel conceptual framework is presented for a new generation of IoT devices that will enable multiple new features for both the IoT administrators as well as end users. Exploiting the recent emergence of software-defined architecture, these smart IoT devices will allow fast, reliable, and intelligent management of diverse IoT-based applications. After highlighting relevant shortcomings of the existing IoT architectures, we outline some key design perspectives to enable front-end intelligence while shedding light on promising future research directions. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Healthcare in the past, decision making was merely based on doctor's personal experience, domain knowledge, patient's physical signs and symptoms and diagnostic laboratory reports. In contrast, devices or things and technologies came into existence playing significant role and helps doctors or physicians to add wisdom to their decision in healthcare monitoring. Cloud paradigm stands as the backbone for on-demand network use of a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) in U-healthcare monitoring system architectures but attached limitations which are solved by Fog(significant extension of cloud). This paper proposed architecture for IoT based u-healthcare monitoring with the motivation and advantages of Cloud to Fog(C2F) computing which interacts more by serving closer to the edge (end points) at smart Homes and Hospitals. © 2016 SERSC.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this study is to analyze how embedding of self-powered wireless sensors into cloud computing further enables such a system to become a sustainable part of work environment. Design/methodology/approach: This is exemplified by an application scenario in healthcare that was developed in the context of the OpSIT project in Germany. A clearly outlined three-layer architecture, in the sense of Internet of Things, is presented. It provides the basis for integrating a broad range of sensors into smart healthcare infrastructure. More specifically, by making use of short-range communication sensors (sensing layer), gateways which implement data transmission and low-level computation (fog layer) and cloud computing for processing the data (application layer). Findings: A technical in-depth analysis of the first two layers of the infrastructure is given to prove reliability and to determine the communication quality and availability in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, two example use-cases that directly apply to a healthcare environment are examined, concluding with the feasibility of the presented approach. Practical implications: Finally, the next research steps, oriented towards the semantic tagging and classification of data received from sensors, and the usage of advanced artificial intelligence-based algorithms on this information to produce useful knowledge, are described together with the derived social benefits. Originality/value: The work presents an innovative, extensible and scalable system, proven to be useful in healthcare environments. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Energy consumption by residential customers represents today around 30 to 40% of the total consumed energy, with the residential loads often to be charged for significant contribution to the peak demands both seasonal and daily. The integration of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) with power delivery infrastructure into Smart Grid (SG) will highly automate the production, distribution, monitoring and management of electric power, but will also introduce issues regarding consumer privacy. Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging scientific area with many practical applications to a vast variety of domains such as smart cities, home automation, autonomous vehicles, assistive technologies and healthcare. IoT is able to facilitate electric power management, by monitoring and controlling energy production and consumption, leading to significant savings. However, the IoT concept introduces several challenges and questions, with security, privacy and interoperability to be among them. In this paper, we discuss the integration of IoT and Fog computing with power systems towards efficient energy management and we illustrate a solution that preserves consumer privacy in smart grids.},

abstract={The size of multi-modal, heterogeneous data collected through various sensors is growing exponentially. It demands intelligent data reduction, data mining and analytics at edge devices. Data compression can reduce the network bandwidth and transmission power consumed by edge devices. This paper proposes, validates and evaluates Fog Data, a service-oriented architecture for Fog computing. The center piece of the proposed architecture is a low power embedded computer that carries out data mining and data analytics on raw data collected from various wearable sensors used for telehealth applications. The embedded computer collects the sensed data as time series, analyzes it, and finds similar patterns present. Patterns are stored, and unique patterns are transmited. Also, the embedded computer extracts clinically relevant information that is sent to the cloud. A working prototype of the proposed architecture was built and used to carry out case studies on telehealth big data applications. Specifically, our case studies used the data from the sensors worn by patients with either speech motor disorders or cardiovascular problems. We implemented and evaluated both generic and application specific data mining techniques to show orders of magnitude data reduction and hence transmission power savings. Quantitative evaluations were conducted for comparing various data mining techniques and standard data compression techniques. The obtained results showed substantial improvement in system efficiency using the Fog Data architecture. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Fog Computing is a new architecture to migrate some data center's tasks to the edge of the server. The fog computing, built on the edge servers, is viewed as a novel architecture that provides the limited computing, storing, and networking services in the distributed way between end devices and the traditional cloud computing Data Centers. It provides the logical intelligence to the end devices and filters the data for Data Centers. The primary objective of fog computing is to ensure the low and predictable latency in the latency-sensitive of Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as the healthcare services. This paper discusses the characteristics of fog computing and services that fog computing can provide in the healthcare system and its prospect. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Lately, pervasive and ubiquitous computing services have been under focus of not only the research community, but developers as well. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time response. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data is to be uploaded in the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, Fog computing plays an important role. Fog resides between underlying IoTs and the cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. For this purpose, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework, which we provide in this paper. Moreover, since Fog has to deal with mobile nodes and IoTs, which involves objects and devices of different types, having a fluctuating connectivity behavior. All such types of service customers have an unpredictable relinquish probability, since any object or device can quit resource utilization at any moment. In our proposed methodology for resource estimation and management, we have taken into account these factors and formulate resource management on the basis of fluctuating relinquish probability of the customer, service type, service price, and variance of the relinquish probability. Implementation of our system was done using Java, while evaluation was done on CloudSim toolkit. The discussion and results show that these factors can help service provider estimate the right amount of resources, according to each type of service customers. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud-computing has emerged as a promising technology to allow boosting a wide range of emerging applications with high processing and storage capabilities, while providing ubiquitous and safe access. Within the list of could-enabled applications, eHealth attracts special attention due to its mission critical requirements, social appeal and innovating opportunities. In our previous work, we proposed the Multi eHealth Cloud Service Framework (MeCa), a holistic cloud-enabled approach, embodying a hub of innovating services that seeks to allow the design of new smart eHealth applications and services. In this work, we present performance evaluation study from migrating MeCa to a Fog computing scenario to obtain performance-improved perspectives. The evaluation results of MeCa on a real testbed, demonstrated its capabilities in enabling to run mobile eHealth applications while achieving enough performance rates in terms to network load, CPU and energy consumption.

abstract={Pervasive and ubiquitous computing services have recently been under focus of not only the research community, but developers as well. Prevailing wireless sensor networks (WSNs), Internet of Things (IoT), and healthcare related services have made it difficult to handle all the data in an efficient and effective way and create more useful services. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Therefore, amalgamation of cloud computing with IoTs, termed as Cloud of Things (CoT) has recently been under discussion in research arena. CoT provides ease of management for the growing media content and other data. Besides this, features like: ubiquitous access, service creation, service discovery, and resource provisioning play a significant role, which comes with CoT. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time response. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data is to be uploaded in the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, Fog computing plays an important role. Fog resides between underlying IoTs and the cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. For this purpose, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework for IoTs, which we provide in this paper. Our model covers the issues of resource prediction, customer type based resource estimation and reservation, advance reservation, and pricing for new and existing IoT customers, on the basis of their characteristics. The implementation was done using Java, while the model was evaluated using CloudSim toolkit. The results and discussion show the validity and performance of our system. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), a new concept that emerged about a year ago, integrating the IT and the Telecom worlds will have a great impact on the openness of the Telecom market. Furthermore, the virtualization revolution that has enabled the Cloud computing success will benefit the Telecom domain, which in turn will be able to support the IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service). The main objective of MEC solution is the export of some Cloud capabilities to the user's proximity decreasing the latency, augmenting the available bandwidth and decreasing the load on the core network. On the other hand, the Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of the future, has benefited from the proliferation in the mobile phones' usage. Many mobile applications have been developed to connect a world of things (wearables, home automation systems, sensors, RFID tags etc.) to the Internet. Even if it is not a complete solution for a scalable IoT architecture but the time sensitive IoT applications (e-healthcare, real time monitoring, etc.) will profit from the MEC architecture. Furthermore, IoT can extend this paradigm to other areas (e.g. Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks) with the use of Software Defined Network (SDN) orchestration to cope with the challenges hindering the IoT real deployment, as we will illustrate in this paper. © 2015 IEEE.},
